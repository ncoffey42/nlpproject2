SHEPPARD AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars died on the night of the 16th–17th September—a Thursday. I\\n\\nwas sent for at eight o’clock on the morning of Friday the 17th. There\\n\\nwas nothing to be done. She had been dead some hours.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was just a few minutes after nine when I reached home once more. I\\n\\nopened the front door with my latch-key, and purposely delayed a few\\n\\nmoments in the hall, hanging up my hat and the light overcoat that\\n\\nI had deemed a wise precaution against the chill of an early autumn\\n\\nmorning. To tell the truth, I was considerably upset and worried. I am\\n\\nnot going to pretend that at that moment I foresaw the events of the\\n\\nnext few weeks. I emphatically did not do so. But my instinct told me\\n\\nthat there were stirring times ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the dining-room on my left there came the rattle of tea-cups and\\n\\nthe short, dry cough of my sister Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is that you, James?” she called.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn unnecessary question, since who else could it be? To tell the\\n\\ntruth, it was precisely my sister Caroline who was the cause of my few\\n\\nminutes’ delay. The motto of the mongoose family, so Mr. Kipling tells\\n\\nus, is: “Go and find out.” If Caroline ever adopts a crest, I should\\n\\ncertainly suggest a mongoose rampant. One might omit the first part\\n\\nof the motto. Caroline can do any amount of finding out by sitting\\n\\nplacidly at home. I don’t know how she manages it, but there it is. I\\n\\nsuspect that the servants and the tradesmen constitute her Intelligence\\n\\nCorps. When she goes out, it is not to gather in information, but to\\n\\nspread it. At that, too, she is amazingly expert.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was really this last named trait of hers which was causing me these\\n\\npangs of indecision. Whatever I told Caroline now concerning the demise\\n\\nof Mrs. Ferrars would be common knowledge all over the village within\\n\\nthe space of an hour and a half. As a professional man, I naturally\\n\\naim at discretion. Therefore I have got into the habit of continually\\n\\nwithholding all information possible from my sister. She usually finds\\n\\nout just the same, but I have the moral satisfaction of knowing that I\\n\\nam in no way to blame.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars’ husband died just over a year ago, and Caroline has\\n\\nconstantly asserted, without the least foundation for the assertion,\\n\\nthat his wife poisoned him.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe scorns my invariable rejoinder that Mr. Ferrars died of acute\\n\\ngastritis, helped on by habitual over-indulgence in alcoholic\\n\\nbeverages. The symptoms of gastritis and arsenical poisoning are not,\\n\\nI agree, unlike, but Caroline bases her accusation on quite different\\n\\nlines.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’ve only got to look at her,” I have heard her say.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars, though not in her first youth, was a very attractive\\n\\nwoman, and her clothes, though simple, always seemed to fit her very\\n\\nwell, but all the same, lots of women buy their clothes in Paris and\\n\\nhave not, on that account, necessarily poisoned their husbands.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I stood hesitating in the hall, with all this passing through my\\n\\nmind, Caroline’s voice came again, with a sharper note in it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What on earth are you doing out there, James? Why don’t you come and\\n\\nget your breakfast?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just coming, my dear,” I said hastily. “I’ve been hanging up my\\n\\novercoat.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You could have hung up half a dozen overcoats in this time.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was quite right. I could have.\\n\\n\\n\\nI walked into the dining-room, gave Caroline the accustomed peck on the\\n\\ncheek, and sat down to eggs and bacon. The bacon was rather cold.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’ve had an early call,” remarked Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I said. “King’s Paddock. Mrs. Ferrars.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know,” said my sister.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How did you know?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Annie told me.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnie is the house parlormaid. A nice girl, but an inveterate talker.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a pause. I continued to eat eggs and bacon. My sister’s nose,\\n\\nwhich is long and thin, quivered a little at the tip, as it always does\\n\\nwhen she is interested or excited over anything.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well?” she demanded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A bad business. Nothing to be done. Must have died in her sleep.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know,” said my sister again.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis time I was annoyed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You can’t know,” I snapped. “I didn’t know myself until I got there,\\n\\nand I haven’t mentioned it to a soul yet. If that girl Annie knows, she\\n\\nmust be a clairvoyant.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It wasn’t Annie who told me. It was the milkman. He had it from the\\n\\nFerrars’ cook.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I say, there is no need for Caroline to go out to get information.\\n\\nShe sits at home, and it comes to her.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy sister continued:\\n\\n\\n\\n“What did she die of? Heart failure?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Didn’t the milkman tell you that?” I inquired sarcastically.\\n\\n\\n\\nSarcasm is wasted on Caroline. She takes it seriously and answers\\n\\naccordingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He didn’t know,” she explained.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter all, Caroline was bound to hear sooner or later. She might as\\n\\nwell hear from me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“She died of an overdose of veronal. She’s been taking it lately for\\n\\nsleeplessness. Must have taken too much.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense,” said Caroline immediately. “She took it on purpose. Don’t\\n\\ntell me!”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is odd how, when you have a secret belief of your own which you do\\n\\nnot wish to acknowledge, the voicing of it by some one else will rouse\\n\\nyou to a fury of denial. I burst immediately into indignant speech.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There you go again,” I said. “Rushing along without rhyme or reason.\\n\\nWhy on earth should Mrs. Ferrars wish to commit suicide? A widow,\\n\\nfairly young still, very well off, good health, and nothing to do but\\n\\nenjoy life. It’s absurd.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not at all. Even you must have noticed how different she has been\\n\\nlooking lately. It’s been coming on for the last six months. She’s\\n\\nlooked positively hag-ridden. And you have just admitted that she\\n\\nhasn’t been able to sleep.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is your diagnosis?” I demanded coldly. “An unfortunate love\\n\\naffair, I suppose?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy sister shook her head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Remorse_,” she said, with great gusto.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Remorse?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes. You never would believe me when I told you she poisoned her\\n\\nhusband. I’m more than ever convinced of it now.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t think you’re very logical,” I objected. “Surely if a woman\\n\\ncommitted a crime like murder, she’d be sufficiently cold-blooded to\\n\\nenjoy the fruits of it without any weak-minded sentimentality such as\\n\\nrepentance.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline shook her head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There probably are women like that—but Mrs. Ferrars wasn’t one of\\n\\nthem. She was a mass of nerves. An overmastering impulse drove her on\\n\\nto get rid of her husband because she was the sort of person who simply\\n\\ncan’t endure suffering of any kind, and there’s no doubt that the wife\\n\\nof a man like Ashley Ferrars must have had to suffer a good deal——”\\n\\n\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And ever since she’s been haunted by what she did. I can’t help\\n\\nfeeling sorry for her.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t think Caroline ever felt sorry for Mrs. Ferrars whilst she was\\n\\nalive. Now that she has gone where (presumably) Paris frocks can no\\n\\nlonger be worn, Caroline is prepared to indulge in the softer emotions\\n\\nof pity and comprehension.\\n\\n\\n\\nI told her firmly that her whole idea was nonsense. I was all the more\\n\\nfirm because I secretly agreed with some part, at least, of what she\\n\\nhad said. But it is all wrong that Caroline should arrive at the truth\\n\\nsimply by a kind of inspired guesswork. I wasn’t going to encourage\\n\\nthat sort of thing. She will go round the village airing her views, and\\n\\nevery one will think that she is doing so on medical data supplied by\\n\\nme. Life is very trying.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense,” said Caroline, in reply to my strictures. “You’ll see. Ten\\n\\nto one she’s left a letter confessing everything.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She didn’t leave a letter of any kind,” I said sharply, and not seeing\\n\\nwhere the admission was going to land me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh!” said Caroline. “So you _did_ inquire about that, did you? I\\n\\nbelieve, James, that in your heart of hearts, you think very much as I\\n\\ndo. You’re a precious old humbug.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“One always has to take the possibility of suicide into consideration,”\\n\\nI said repressively.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Will there be an inquest?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“There may be. It all depends. If I am able to declare myself\\n\\nabsolutely satisfied that the overdose was taken accidentally, an\\n\\ninquest might be dispensed with.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And are you absolutely satisfied?” asked my sister shrewdly.\\n\\n\\n\\nI did not answer, but got up from table.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER II\\n\\n\\n\\n                       WHO’S WHO IN KING’S ABBOT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore I proceed further with what I said to Caroline and what Caroline\\n\\nsaid to me, it might be as well to give some idea of what I should\\n\\ndescribe as our local geography. Our village, King’s Abbot, is, I\\n\\nimagine, very much like any other village. Our big town is Cranchester,\\n\\nnine miles away. We have a large railway station, a small post office,\\n\\nand two rival “General Stores.” Able-bodied men are apt to leave the\\n\\nplace early in life, but we are rich in unmarried ladies and retired\\n\\nmilitary officers. Our hobbies and recreations can be summed up in the\\n\\none word, “gossip.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are only two houses of any importance in King’s Abbot. One\\n\\nis King’s Paddock, left to Mrs. Ferrars by her late husband. The\\n\\nother, Fernly Park, is owned by Roger Ackroyd. Ackroyd has always\\n\\ninterested me by being a man more impossibly like a country squire\\n\\nthan any country squire could really be. He reminds one of the\\n\\nred-faced sportsmen who always appeared early in the first act of an\\n\\nold-fashioned musical comedy, the setting being the village green. They\\n\\nusually sang a song about going up to London. Nowadays we have revues,\\n\\nand the country squire has died out of musical fashion.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course, Ackroyd is not really a country squire. He is an immensely\\n\\nsuccessful manufacturer of (I think) wagon wheels. He is a man of\\n\\nnearly fifty years of age, rubicund of face and genial of manner.\\n\\nHe is hand and glove with the vicar, subscribes liberally to parish\\n\\nfunds (though rumor has it that he is extremely mean in personal\\n\\nexpenditure), encourages cricket matches, Lads’ Clubs, and Disabled\\n\\nSoldiers’ Institutes. He is, in fact, the life and soul of our peaceful\\n\\nvillage of King’s Abbot.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow when Roger Ackroyd was a lad of twenty-one, he fell in love with,\\n\\nand married, a beautiful woman some five or six years his senior. Her\\n\\nname was Paton, and she was a widow with one child. The history of the\\n\\nmarriage was short and painful. To put it bluntly, Mrs. Ackroyd was\\n\\na dipsomaniac. She succeeded in drinking herself into her grave four\\n\\nyears after her marriage.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the years that followed, Ackroyd showed no disposition to make a\\n\\nsecond matrimonial adventure. His wife’s child by her first marriage\\n\\nwas only seven years old when his mother died. He is now twenty-five.\\n\\nAckroyd has always regarded him as his own son, and has brought him up\\n\\naccordingly, but he has been a wild lad and a continual source of worry\\n\\nand trouble to his stepfather. Nevertheless we are all very fond of\\n\\nRalph Paton in King’s Abbot. He is such a good-looking youngster for\\n\\none thing.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I said before, we are ready enough to gossip in our village.\\n\\nEverybody noticed from the first that Ackroyd and Mrs. Ferrars got on\\n\\nvery well together. After her husband’s death, the intimacy became\\n\\nmore marked. They were always seen about together, and it was freely\\n\\nconjectured that at the end of her period of mourning, Mrs. Ferrars\\n\\nwould become Mrs. Roger Ackroyd. It was felt, indeed, that there was a\\n\\ncertain fitness in the thing. Roger Ackroyd’s wife had admittedly died\\n\\nof drink. Ashley Ferrars had been a drunkard for many years before his\\n\\ndeath. It was only fitting that these two victims of alcoholic excess\\n\\nshould make up to each other for all that they had previously endured\\n\\nat the hands of their former spouses.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Ferrars only came to live here just over a year ago, but a halo of\\n\\ngossip has surrounded Ackroyd for many years past. All the time that\\n\\nRalph Paton was growing up to manhood, a series of lady housekeepers\\n\\npresided over Ackroyd’s establishment, and each in turn was regarded\\n\\nwith lively suspicion by Caroline and her cronies. It is not too\\n\\nmuch to say that for at least fifteen years the whole village has\\n\\nconfidently expected Ackroyd to marry one of his housekeepers. The last\\n\\nof them, a redoubtable lady called Miss Russell, has reigned undisputed\\n\\nfor five years, twice as long as any of her predecessors. It is felt\\n\\nthat but for the advent of Mrs. Ferrars, Ackroyd could hardly have\\n\\nescaped. That—and one other factor—the unexpected arrival of a widowed\\n\\nsister-in-law with her daughter from Canada. Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd, widow\\n\\nof Ackroyd’s ne’er-do-well younger brother, has taken up her residence\\n\\nat Fernly Park, and has succeeded, according to Caroline, in putting\\n\\nMiss Russell in her proper place.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t know exactly what a “proper place” constitutes—it sounds chilly\\n\\nand unpleasant—but I know that Miss Russell goes about with pinched\\n\\nlips, and what I can only describe as an acid smile, and that she\\n\\nprofesses the utmost sympathy for “poor Mrs. Ackroyd—dependent on the\\n\\ncharity of her husband’s brother. The bread of charity is so bitter, is\\n\\nit not? _I_ should be quite miserable if I did not work for my living.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t know what Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd thought of the Ferrars affair when\\n\\nit came on the tapis. It was clearly to her advantage that Ackroyd\\n\\nshould remain unmarried. She was always very charming—not to say\\n\\ngushing—to Mrs. Ferrars when they met. Caroline says that proves less\\n\\nthan nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch have been our preoccupations in King’s Abbot for the last few\\n\\nyears. We have discussed Ackroyd and his affairs from every standpoint.\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars has fitted into her place in the scheme.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow there has been a rearrangement of the kaleidoscope. From a mild\\n\\ndiscussion of probable wedding presents, we have been jerked into the\\n\\nmidst of tragedy.\\n\\n\\n\\nRevolving these and sundry other matters in my mind, I went\\n\\nmechanically on my round. I had no cases of special interest to attend,\\n\\nwhich was, perhaps, as well, for my thoughts returned again and again\\n\\nto the mystery of Mrs. Ferrars’s death. Had she taken her own life?\\n\\nSurely, if she had done so, she would have left some word behind to\\n\\nsay what she contemplated doing? Women, in my experience, if they once\\n\\nreach the determination to commit suicide, usually wish to reveal the\\n\\nstate of mind that led to the fatal action. They covet the limelight.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen had I last seen her? Not for over a week. Her manner then had been\\n\\nnormal enough considering—well—considering everything.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen I suddenly remembered that I had seen her, though not to speak\\n\\nto, only yesterday. She had been walking with Ralph Paton, and I had\\n\\nbeen surprised because I had had no idea that he was likely to be in\\n\\nKing’s Abbot. I thought, indeed, that he had quarreled finally with\\n\\nhis stepfather. Nothing had been seen of him down here for nearly six\\n\\nmonths. They had been walking along, side by side, their heads close\\n\\ntogether, and she had been talking very earnestly.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think I can safely say that it was at this moment that a foreboding\\n\\nof the future first swept over me. Nothing tangible as yet—but a vague\\n\\npremonition of the way things were setting. That earnest _tête-à-tête_\\n\\nbetween Ralph Paton and Mrs. Ferrars the day before struck me\\n\\ndisagreeably.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was still thinking of it when I came face to face with Roger Ackroyd.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sheppard!” he exclaimed. “Just the man I wanted to get hold of. This\\n\\nis a terrible business.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’ve heard then?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe nodded. He had felt the blow keenly, I could see. His big red cheeks\\n\\nseemed to have fallen in, and he looked a positive wreck of his usual\\n\\njolly, healthy self.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s worse than you know,” he said quietly. “Look here, Sheppard, I’ve\\n\\ngot to talk to you. Can you come back with me now?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hardly. I’ve got three patients to see still, and I must be back by\\n\\ntwelve to see my surgery patients.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then this afternoon—no, better still, dine to-night. At 7.30? Will\\n\\nthat suit you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes—I can manage that all right. What’s wrong? Is it Ralph?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI hardly knew why I said that—except, perhaps, that it had so often\\n\\nbeen Ralph.\\n\\n\\n\\nAckroyd stared blankly at me as though he hardly understood. I began to\\n\\nrealize that there must be something very wrong indeed somewhere. I had\\n\\nnever seen Ackroyd so upset before.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ralph?” he said vaguely. “Oh! no, it’s not Ralph. Ralph’s in\\n\\nLondon——Damn! Here’s old Miss Ganett coming. I don’t want to have to\\n\\ntalk to her about this ghastly business. See you to-night, Sheppard.\\n\\nSeven-thirty.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI nodded, and he hurried away, leaving me wondering. Ralph in London?\\n\\nBut he had certainly been in King’s Abbot the preceding afternoon. He\\n\\nmust have gone back to town last night or early this morning, and yet\\n\\nAckroyd’s manner had conveyed quite a different impression. He had\\n\\nspoken as though Ralph had not been near the place for months.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had no time to puzzle the matter out further. Miss Ganett was upon\\n\\nme, thirsting for information. Miss Ganett has all the characteristics\\n\\nof my sister Caroline, but she lacks that unerring aim in jumping to\\n\\nconclusions which lends a touch of greatness to Caroline’s maneuvers.\\n\\nMiss Ganett was breathless and interrogatory.\\n\\n\\n\\nWasn’t it sad about poor dear Mrs. Ferrars? A lot of people were saying\\n\\nshe had been a confirmed drug-taker for years. So wicked the way\\n\\npeople went about saying things. And yet, the worst of it was, there\\n\\nwas usually a grain of truth somewhere in these wild statements. No\\n\\nsmoke without fire! They were saying too that Mr. Ackroyd had found\\n\\nout about it, and had broken off the engagement—because there _was_ an\\n\\nengagement. She, Miss Ganett, had proof positive of that. Of course _I_\\n\\nmust know all about it—doctors always did—but they never tell?\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd all this with a sharp beady eye on me to see how I reacted to\\n\\nthese suggestions. Fortunately long association with Caroline has led\\n\\nme to preserve an impassive countenance, and to be ready with small\\n\\nnon-committal remarks.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn this occasion I congratulated Miss Ganett on not joining in\\n\\nill-natured gossip. Rather a neat counterattack, I thought. It left\\n\\nher in difficulties, and before she could pull herself together, I had\\n\\npassed on.\\n\\n\\n\\nI went home thoughtful, to find several patients waiting for me in the\\n\\nsurgery.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had dismissed the last of them, as I thought, and was just\\n\\ncontemplating a few minutes in the garden before lunch when I perceived\\n\\none more patient waiting for me. She rose and came towards me as I\\n\\nstood somewhat surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t know why I should have been, except that there is a suggestion\\n\\nof cast iron about Miss Russell, a something that is above the ills of\\n\\nthe flesh.\\n\\n\\n\\nAckroyd’s housekeeper is a tall woman, handsome but forbidding in\\n\\nappearance. She has a stern eye, and lips that shut tightly, and I feel\\n\\nthat if I were an under housemaid or a kitchenmaid I should run for my\\n\\nlife whenever I heard her coming.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good morning, Dr. Sheppard,” said Miss Russell. “I should be much\\n\\nobliged if you would take a look at my knee.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI took a look, but, truth to tell, I was very little wiser when I had\\n\\ndone so. Miss Russell’s account of vague pains was so unconvincing that\\n\\nwith a woman of less integrity of character I should have suspected a\\n\\ntrumped-up tale. It did cross my mind for one moment that Miss Russell\\n\\nmight have deliberately invented this affection of the knee in order\\n\\nto pump me on the subject of Mrs. Ferrars’s death, but I soon saw that\\n\\nthere, at least, I had misjudged her. She made a brief reference to the\\n\\ntragedy, nothing more. Yet she certainly seemed disposed to linger and\\n\\nchat.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, thank you very much for this bottle of liniment, doctor,” she\\n\\nsaid at last. “Not that I believe it will do the least good.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI didn’t think it would either, but I protested in duty bound. After\\n\\nall, it couldn’t do any harm, and one must stick up for the tools of\\n\\none’s trade.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t believe in all these drugs,” said Miss Russell, her eyes\\n\\nsweeping over my array of bottles disparagingly. “Drugs do a lot of\\n\\nharm. Look at the cocaine habit.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, as far as that goes——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s very prevalent in high society.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m sure Miss Russell knows far more about high society than I do. I\\n\\ndidn’t attempt to argue with her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just tell me this, doctor,” said Miss Russell. “Suppose you are really\\n\\na slave of the drug habit. Is there any cure?”\\n\\n\\n\\nOne cannot answer a question like that offhand. I gave her a short\\n\\nlecture on the subject, and she listened with close attention. I still\\n\\nsuspected her of seeking information about Mrs. Ferrars.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, veronal, for instance——” I proceeded.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, strangely enough, she didn’t seem interested in veronal. Instead\\n\\nshe changed the subject, and asked me if it was true that there were\\n\\ncertain poisons so rare as to baffle detection.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” I said. “You’ve been reading detective stories.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe admitted that she had.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The essence of a detective story,” I said, “is to have a rare\\n\\npoison—if possible something from South America, that nobody has ever\\n\\nheard of—something that one obscure tribe of savages use to poison\\n\\ntheir arrows with. Death is instantaneous, and Western science is\\n\\npowerless to detect it. That is the kind of thing you mean?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes. Is there really such a thing?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI shook my head regretfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m afraid there isn’t. There’s _curare_, of course.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI told her a good deal about curare, but she seemed to have lost\\n\\ninterest once more. She asked me if I had any in my poison cupboard,\\n\\nand when I replied in the negative I fancy I fell in her estimation.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe said she must be getting back, and I saw her out at the surgery\\n\\ndoor just as the luncheon gong went.\\n\\n\\n\\nI should never have suspected Miss Russell of a fondness for detective\\n\\nstories. It pleases me very much to think of her stepping out of the\\n\\nhousekeeper’s room to rebuke a delinquent housemaid, and then returning\\n\\nto a comfortable perusal of _The Mystery of the Seventh Death_, or\\n\\nsomething of the kind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER III\\n\\n\\n\\n                  THE MAN WHO GREW VEGETABLE MARROWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI told Caroline at lunch time that I should be dining at Fernly. She\\n\\nexpressed no objection—on the contrary——\\n\\n\\n\\n“Excellent,” she said. “You’ll hear all about it. By the way, what is\\n\\nthe trouble with Ralph?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“With Ralph?” I said, surprised; “there’s isn’t any.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then why is he staying at the Three Boars instead of at Fernly Park?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI did not for a minute question Caroline’s statement that Ralph Paton\\n\\nwas staying at the local inn. That Caroline said so was enough for me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ackroyd told me he was in London,” I said. In the surprise of\\n\\nthe moment I departed from my valuable rule of never parting with\\n\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh!” said Caroline. I could see her nose twitching as she worked on\\n\\nthis.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He arrived at the Three Boars yesterday morning,” she said. “And he’s\\n\\nstill there. Last night he was out with a girl.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThat did not surprise me in the least. Ralph, I should say, is out\\n\\nwith a girl most nights of his life. But I did rather wonder that he\\n\\nchose to indulge in the pastime in King’s Abbot instead of in the gay\\n\\nmetropolis.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One of the barmaids?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No. That’s just it. He went out to meet her. I don’t know who she is.”\\n\\n\\n\\n(Bitter for Caroline to have to admit such a thing.)\\n\\n\\n\\n“But I can guess,” continued my indefatigable sister.\\n\\n\\n\\nI waited patiently.\\n\\n\\n\\n“His cousin.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Flora Ackroyd?” I exclaimed in surprise.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora Ackroyd is, of course, no relation whatever really to Ralph\\n\\nPaton, but Ralph has been looked upon for so long as practically\\n\\nAckroyd’s own son, that cousinship is taken for granted.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Flora Ackroyd,” said my sister.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But why not go to Fernly if he wanted to see her?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Secretly engaged,” said Caroline, with immense enjoyment. “Old Ackroyd\\n\\nwon’t hear of it, and they have to meet this way.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw a good many flaws in Caroline’s theory, but I forbore to point\\n\\nthem out to her. An innocent remark about our new neighbor created a\\n\\ndiversion.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe house next door, The Larches, has recently been taken by a\\n\\nstranger. To Caroline’s extreme annoyance, she has not been able\\n\\nto find out anything about him, except that he is a foreigner. The\\n\\nIntelligence Corps has proved a broken reed. Presumably the man has\\n\\nmilk and vegetables and joints of meat and occasional whitings just\\n\\nlike everybody else, but none of the people who make it their business\\n\\nto supply these things seem to have acquired any information. His name,\\n\\napparently, is Mr. Porrott—a name which conveys an odd feeling of\\n\\nunreality. The one thing we do know about him is that he is interested\\n\\nin the growing of vegetable marrows.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that is certainly not the sort of information that Caroline is\\n\\nafter. She wants to know where he comes from, what he does, whether he\\n\\nis married, what his wife was, or is, like, whether he has children,\\n\\nwhat his mother’s maiden name was—and so on. Somebody very like\\n\\nCaroline must have invented the questions on passports, I think.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear Caroline,” I said. “There’s no doubt at all about what the\\n\\nman’s profession has been. He’s a retired hairdresser. Look at that\\n\\nmustache of his.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline dissented. She said that if the man was a hairdresser, he\\n\\nwould have wavy hair—not straight. All hairdressers did.\\n\\n\\n\\nI cited several hairdressers personally known to me who had straight\\n\\nhair, but Caroline refused to be convinced.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can’t make him out at all,” she said in an aggrieved voice. “I\\n\\nborrowed some garden tools the other day, and he was most polite, but\\n\\nI couldn’t get anything out of him. I asked him point blank at last\\n\\nwhether he was a Frenchman, and he said he wasn’t—and somehow I didn’t\\n\\nlike to ask him any more.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI began to be more interested in our mysterious neighbor. A man who\\n\\nis capable of shutting up Caroline and sending her, like the Queen of\\n\\nSheba, empty away must be something of a personality.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I believe,” said Caroline, “that he’s got one of those new vacuum\\n\\ncleaners——”\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw a meditated loan and the opportunity of further questioning\\n\\ngleaming from her eye. I seized the chance to escape into the garden.\\n\\nI am rather fond of gardening. I was busily exterminating dandelion\\n\\nroots when a shout of warning sounded from close by and a heavy body\\n\\nwhizzed by my ear and fell at my feet with a repellant squelch. It was\\n\\na vegetable marrow!\\n\\n\\n\\nI looked up angrily. Over the wall, to my left, there appeared a face.\\n\\nAn egg-shaped head, partially covered with suspiciously black hair, two\\n\\nimmense mustaches, and a pair of watchful eyes. It was our mysterious\\n\\nneighbor, Mr. Porrott.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe broke at once into fluent apologies.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I demand of you a thousand pardons, monsieur. I am without defense.\\n\\nFor some months now I cultivate the marrows. This morning suddenly\\n\\nI enrage myself with these marrows. I send them to promenade\\n\\nthemselves—alas! not only mentally but physically. I seize the biggest.\\n\\nI hurl him over the wall. Monsieur, I am ashamed. I prostrate myself.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore such profuse apologies, my anger was forced to melt. After\\n\\nall, the wretched vegetable hadn’t hit me. But I sincerely hoped that\\n\\nthrowing large vegetables over walls was not our new friend’s hobby.\\n\\nSuch a habit could hardly endear him to us as a neighbor.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe strange little man seemed to read my thoughts.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! no,” he exclaimed. “Do not disquiet yourself. It is not with me a\\n\\nhabit. But can you figure to yourself, monsieur, that a man may work\\n\\ntowards a certain object, may labor and toil to attain a certain kind\\n\\nof leisure and occupation, and then find that, after all, he yearns\\n\\nfor the old busy days, and the old occupations that he thought himself\\n\\nso glad to leave?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I said slowly. “I fancy that that is a common enough occurrence.\\n\\nI myself am perhaps an instance. A year ago I came into a legacy—enough\\n\\nto enable me to realize a dream. I have always wanted to travel, to see\\n\\nthe world. Well, that was a year ago, as I said, and—I am still here.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy little neighbor nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The chains of habit. We work to attain an object, and the object\\n\\ngained, we find that what we miss is the daily toil. And mark you,\\n\\nmonsieur, my work was interesting work. The most interesting work there\\n\\nis in the world.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes?” I said encouragingly. For the moment the spirit of Caroline was\\n\\nstrong within me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The study of human nature, monsieur!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just so,” I said kindly.\\n\\n\\n\\nClearly a retired hairdresser. Who knows the secrets of human nature\\n\\nbetter than a hairdresser?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Also, I had a friend—a friend who for many years never left my side.\\n\\nOccasionally of an imbecility to make one afraid, nevertheless he was\\n\\nvery dear to me. Figure to yourself that I miss even his stupidity.\\n\\nHis _naïveté_, his honest outlook, the pleasure of delighting and\\n\\nsurprising him by my superior gifts—all these I miss more than I can\\n\\ntell you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He died?” I asked sympathetically.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not so. He lives and flourishes—but on the other side of the world. He\\n\\nis now in the Argentine.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“In the Argentine,” I said enviously.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have always wanted to go to South America. I sighed, and then\\n\\nlooked up to find Mr. Porrott eyeing me sympathetically. He seemed an\\n\\nunderstanding little man.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You will go there, yes?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nI shook my head with a sigh.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I could have gone,” I said, “a year ago. But I was foolish—and worse\\n\\nthan foolish—greedy. I risked the substance for the shadow.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I comprehend,” said Mr. Porrott. “You speculated?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI nodded mournfully, but in spite of myself I felt secretly\\n\\nentertained. This ridiculous little man was so portentously solemn.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not the Porcupine Oilfields?” he asked suddenly.\\n\\n\\n\\nI stared.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thought of them, as a matter of fact, but in the end I plumped for a\\n\\ngold mine in Western Australia.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy neighbor was regarding me with a strange expression which I could\\n\\nnot fathom.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is Fate,” he said at last.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is Fate?” I asked irritably.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That I should live next to a man who seriously considers Porcupine\\n\\nOilfields, and also West Australian Gold Mines. Tell me, have you also\\n\\na penchant for auburn hair?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI stared at him open-mouthed, and he burst out laughing.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, no, it is not the insanity that I suffer from. Make your mind\\n\\neasy. It was a foolish question that I put to you there, for, see you,\\n\\nmy friend of whom I spoke was a young man, a man who thought all women\\n\\ngood, and most of them beautiful. But you are a man of middle age, a\\n\\ndoctor, a man who knows the folly and the vanity of most things in this\\n\\nlife of ours. Well, well, we are neighbors. I beg of you to accept and\\n\\npresent to your excellent sister my best marrow.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stooped, and with a flourish produced an immense specimen of the\\n\\ntribe, which I duly accepted in the spirit in which it was offered.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Indeed,” said the little man cheerfully, “this has not been a wasted\\n\\nmorning. I have made the acquaintance of a man who in some ways\\n\\nresembles my far-off friend. By the way, I should like to ask you a\\n\\nquestion. You doubtless know every one in this tiny village. Who is the\\n\\nyoung man with the very dark hair and eyes, and the handsome face. He\\n\\nwalks with his head flung back, and an easy smile on his lips?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe description left me in no doubt.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That must be Captain Ralph Paton,” I said slowly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have not seen him about here before?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, he has not been here for some time. But he is the son—adopted son,\\n\\nrather—of Mr. Ackroyd of Fernly Park.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy neighbor made a slight gesture of impatience.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course, I should have guessed. Mr. Ackroyd spoke of him many times.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You know Mr. Ackroyd?” I said, slightly surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Ackroyd knew me in London—when I was at work there. I have asked\\n\\nhim to say nothing of my profession down here.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I see,” I said, rather amused by this patent snobbery, as I thought it.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the little man went on with an almost grandiloquent smirk.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One prefers to remain incognito. I am not anxious for notoriety. I\\n\\nhave not even troubled to correct the local version of my name.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Indeed,” I said, not knowing quite what to say.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Captain Ralph Paton,” mused Mr. Porrott. “And so he is engaged to Mr.\\n\\nAckroyd’s niece, the charming Miss Flora.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who told you so?” I asked, very much surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Ackroyd. About a week ago. He is very pleased about it—has long\\n\\ndesired that such a thing should come to pass, or so I understood\\n\\nfrom him. I even believe that he brought some pressure to bear upon\\n\\nthe young man. That is never wise. A young man should marry to please\\n\\nhimself—not to please a stepfather from whom he has expectations.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy ideas were completely upset. I could not see Ackroyd taking a\\n\\nhairdresser into his confidence, and discussing the marriage of his\\n\\nniece and stepson with him. Ackroyd extends a genial patronage to the\\n\\nlower orders, but he has a very great sense of his own dignity. I began\\n\\nto think that Porrott couldn’t be a hairdresser after all.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo hide my confusion, I said the first thing that came into my head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What made you notice Ralph Paton? His good looks?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, not that alone—though he is unusually good-looking for an\\n\\nEnglishman—what your lady novelists would call a Greek God. No, there\\n\\nwas something about that young man that I did not understand.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said the last sentence in a musing tone of voice which made an\\n\\nindefinable impression upon me. It was as though he was summing up the\\n\\nboy by the light of some inner knowledge that I did not share. It was\\n\\nthat impression that was left with me, for at that moment my sister’s\\n\\nvoice called me from the house.\\n\\n\\n\\nI went in. Caroline had her hat on, and had evidently just come in from\\n\\nthe village. She began without preamble.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I met Mr. Ackroyd.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes?” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I stopped him, of course, but he seemed in a great hurry, and anxious\\n\\nto get away.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI have no doubt but that that was the case. He would feel towards\\n\\nCaroline much as he had felt towards Miss Ganett earlier in the\\n\\nday—perhaps more so. Caroline is less easy to shake off.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I asked him at once about Ralph. He was absolutely astonished. Had no\\n\\nidea the boy was down here. He actually said he thought I must have\\n\\nmade a mistake. I! A mistake!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ridiculous,” I said. “He ought to have known you better.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then he went on to tell me that Ralph and Flora are engaged.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know that too,” I interrupted, with modest pride.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who told you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Our new neighbor.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline visibly wavered for a second or two, much as a roulette ball\\n\\nmight coyly hover between two numbers. Then she declined the tempting\\n\\nred herring.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I told Mr. Ackroyd that Ralph was staying at the Three Boars.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Caroline,” I said, “do you never reflect that you might do a lot of\\n\\nharm with this habit of yours of repeating everything indiscriminately?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense,” said my sister. “People ought to know things. I consider it\\n\\nmy duty to tell them. Mr. Ackroyd was very grateful to me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well?” I said, for there was clearly more to come.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think he went straight off to the Three Boars, but if so he didn’t\\n\\nfind Ralph there.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No. Because as I was coming back through the wood——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Coming back through the wood?” I interrupted.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline had the grace to blush.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was such a lovely day,” she exclaimed. “I thought I would make a\\n\\nlittle round. The woods with their autumnal tints are so perfect at\\n\\nthis time of year.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline does not care a hang for woods at any time of year. Normally\\n\\nshe regards them as places where you get your feet damp, and where all\\n\\nkinds of unpleasant things may drop on your head. No, it was good sound\\n\\nmongoose instinct which took her to our local wood. It is the only\\n\\nplace adjacent to the village of King’s Abbot where you can talk with\\n\\na young woman unseen by the whole of the village. It adjoins the Park\\n\\nof Fernly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” I said, “go on.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“As I say, I was just coming back through the wood when I heard voices.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline paused.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“One was Ralph Paton’s—I knew it at once. The other was a girl’s. Of\\n\\ncourse I didn’t mean to listen——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course not,” I interjected, with patent sarcasm—which was, however,\\n\\nwasted on Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But I simply couldn’t help overhearing. The girl said something—I\\n\\ndidn’t quite catch what it was, and Ralph answered. He sounded very\\n\\nangry. ‘My dear girl,’ he said. ‘Don’t you realize that it is quite\\n\\non the cards the old man will cut me off with a shilling? He’s been\\n\\npretty fed up with me for the last few years. A little more would do\\n\\nit. And we need the dibs, my dear. I shall be a very rich man when\\n\\nthe old fellow pops off. He’s mean as they make ’em, but he’s rolling\\n\\nin money really. I don’t want him to go altering his will. You leave\\n\\nit to me, and don’t worry.’ Those were his exact words. I remember\\n\\nthem perfectly. Unfortunately, just then I stepped on a dry twig or\\n\\nsomething, and they lowered their voices and moved away. I couldn’t, of\\n\\ncourse, go rushing after them, so wasn’t able to see who the girl was.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That must have been most vexing,” I said. “I suppose, though, you\\n\\nhurried on to the Three Boars, felt faint, and went into the bar for a\\n\\nglass of brandy, and so were able to see if both the barmaids were on\\n\\nduty?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It wasn’t a barmaid,” said Caroline unhesitatingly. “In fact, I’m\\n\\nalmost sure that it was Flora Ackroyd, only——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Only it doesn’t seem to make sense,” I agreed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But if it wasn’t Flora, who could it have been?”\\n\\n\\n\\nRapidly my sister ran over a list of maidens living in the\\n\\nneighborhood, with profuse reasons for and against.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen she paused for breath, I murmured something about a patient, and\\n\\nslipped out.\\n\\n\\n\\nI proposed to make my way to the Three Boars. It seemed likely that\\n\\nRalph Paton would have returned there by now.\\n\\n\\n\\nI knew Ralph very well—better, perhaps, than any one else in King’s\\n\\nAbbot, for I had known his mother before him, and therefore I\\n\\nunderstood much in him that puzzled others. He was, to a certain\\n\\nextent, the victim of heredity. He had not inherited his mother’s\\n\\nfatal propensity for drink, but nevertheless he had in him a strain\\n\\nof weakness. As my new friend of this morning had declared, he was\\n\\nextraordinarily handsome. Just on six feet, perfectly proportioned,\\n\\nwith the easy grace of an athlete, he was dark, like his mother,\\n\\nwith a handsome, sunburnt face always ready to break into a smile.\\n\\nRalph Paton was of those born to charm easily and without effort. He\\n\\nwas self-indulgent and extravagant, with no veneration for anything\\n\\non earth, but he was lovable nevertheless, and his friends were all\\n\\ndevoted to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nCould I do anything with the boy? I thought I could.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn inquiry at the Three Boars I found that Captain Paton had just come\\n\\nin. I went up to his room and entered unannounced.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment, remembering what I had heard and seen, I was doubtful of\\n\\nmy reception, but I need have had no misgivings.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why, it’s Sheppard! Glad to see you.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe came forward to meet me, hand outstretched, a sunny smile lighting\\n\\nup his face.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The one person I am glad to see in this infernal place.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI raised my eyebrows.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s the place been doing?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe gave a vexed laugh.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s a long story. Things haven’t been going well with me, doctor. But\\n\\nhave a drink, won’t you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Thanks,” I said, “I will.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe pressed the bell, then, coming back, threw himself into a chair.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not to mince matters,” he said gloomily, “I’m in the devil of a mess.\\n\\nIn fact, I haven’t the least idea what to do next.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” I asked sympathetically.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s my confounded stepfather.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What has he done?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It isn’t what he’s done yet, but what he’s likely to do.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bell was answered, and Ralph ordered the drinks. When the man had\\n\\ngone again, he sat hunched in the arm-chair, frowning to himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is it really—serious?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m fairly up against it this time,” he said soberly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe unusual ring of gravity in his voice told me that he spoke the\\n\\ntruth. It took a good deal to make Ralph grave.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In fact,” he continued, “I can’t see my way ahead.... I’m damned if I\\n\\ncan.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If I could help——” I suggested diffidently.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut he shook his head very decidedly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good of you, doctor. But I can’t let you in on this. I’ve got to play\\n\\na lone hand.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was silent a minute and then repeated in a slightly different tone\\n\\nof voice:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes—I’ve got to play a lone hand....”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\n\\n                           DINNER AT FERNLY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was just a few minutes before half-past seven when I rang the\\n\\nfront door bell of Fernly Park. The door was opened with admirable\\n\\npromptitude by Parker, the butler.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe night was such a fine one that I had preferred to come on foot. I\\n\\nstepped into the big square hall and Parker relieved me of my overcoat.\\n\\nJust then Ackroyd’s secretary, a pleasant young fellow by the name of\\n\\nRaymond, passed through the hall on his way to Ackroyd’s study, his\\n\\nhands full of papers.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good-evening, doctor. Coming to dine? Or is this a professional call?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last was in allusion to my black bag, which I had laid down on the\\n\\noak chest.\\n\\n\\n\\nI explained that I expected a summons to a confinement case at any\\n\\nmoment, and so had come out prepared for an emergency call. Raymond\\n\\nnodded, and went on his way, calling over his shoulder:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Go into the drawing-room. You know the way. The ladies will be down in\\n\\na minute. I must just take these papers to Mr. Ackroyd, and I’ll tell\\n\\nhim you’re here.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Raymond’s appearance Parker had withdrawn, so I was alone in the\\n\\nhall. I settled my tie, glanced in a large mirror which hung there, and\\n\\ncrossed to the door directly facing me, which was, as I knew, the door\\n\\nof the drawing-room.\\n\\n\\n\\nI noticed, just as I was turning the handle, a sound from within—the\\n\\nshutting down of a window, I took it to be. I noted it, I may say,\\n\\nquite mechanically, without attaching any importance to it at the time.\\n\\n\\n\\nI opened the door and walked in. As I did so, I almost collided with\\n\\nMiss Russell, who was just coming out. We both apologized.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the first time I found myself appraising the housekeeper and\\n\\nthinking what a handsome woman she must once have been—indeed, as far\\n\\nas that goes, still was. Her dark hair was unstreaked with gray, and\\n\\nwhen she had a color, as she had at this minute, the stern quality of\\n\\nher looks was not so apparent.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuite subconsciously I wondered whether she had been out, for she was\\n\\nbreathing hard, as though she had been running.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m afraid I’m a few minutes early,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! I don’t think so. It’s gone half-past seven, Dr. Sheppard.” She\\n\\npaused a minute before saying, “I—didn’t know you were expected to\\n\\ndinner to-night. Mr. Ackroyd didn’t mention it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI received a vague impression that my dining there displeased her in\\n\\nsome way, but I couldn’t imagine why.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How’s the knee?” I inquired.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Much the same, thank you, doctor. I must be going now. Mrs. Ackroyd\\n\\nwill be down in a moment. I—I only came in here to see if the flowers\\n\\nwere all right.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe passed quickly out of the room. I strolled to the window,\\n\\nwondering at her evident desire to justify her presence in the room. As\\n\\nI did so, I saw what, of course, I might have known all the time had\\n\\nI troubled to give my mind to it, namely, that the windows were long\\n\\nFrench ones opening on the terrace. The sound I had heard, therefore,\\n\\ncould not have been that of a window being shut down.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuite idly, and more to distract my mind from painful thoughts than for\\n\\nany other reason, I amused myself by trying to guess what could have\\n\\ncaused the sound in question.\\n\\n\\n\\nCoals on the fire? No, that was not the kind of noise at all. A drawer\\n\\nof the bureau pushed in? No, not that.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen my eye was caught by what, I believe, is called a silver table,\\n\\nthe lid of which lifts, and through the glass of which you can see the\\n\\ncontents. I crossed over to it, studying the things. There were one\\n\\nor two pieces of old silver, a baby shoe belonging to King Charles\\n\\nthe First, some Chinese jade figures, and quite a number of African\\n\\nimplements and curios. Wanting to examine one of the jade figures more\\n\\nclosely, I lifted the lid. It slipped through my fingers and fell.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt once I recognized the sound I had heard. It was this same table lid\\n\\nbeing shut down gently and carefully. I repeated the action once or\\n\\ntwice for my own satisfaction. Then I lifted the lid to scrutinize the\\n\\ncontents more closely.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was still bending over the open silver table when Flora Ackroyd came\\n\\ninto the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuite a lot of people do not like Flora Ackroyd, but nobody can help\\n\\nadmiring her. And to her friends she can be very charming. The first\\n\\nthing that strikes you about her is her extraordinary fairness. She has\\n\\nthe real Scandinavian pale gold hair. Her eyes are blue—blue as the\\n\\nwaters of a Norwegian fiord, and her skin is cream and roses. She has\\n\\nsquare, boyish shoulders and slight hips. And to a jaded medical man it\\n\\nis very refreshing to come across such perfect health.\\n\\n\\n\\nA simple straight-forward English girl—I may be old-fashioned, but I\\n\\nthink the genuine article takes a lot of beating.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora joined me by the silver table, and expressed heretical doubts as\\n\\nto King Charles I ever having worn the baby shoe.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And anyway,” continued Miss Flora, “all this making a fuss about\\n\\nthings because some one wore or used them seems to me all nonsense.\\n\\nThey’re not wearing or using them now. The pen that George Eliot wrote\\n\\n_The Mill on the Floss_ with—that sort of thing—well, it’s only just a\\n\\npen after all. If you’re really keen on George Eliot, why not get _The\\n\\nMill on the Floss_ in a cheap edition and read it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I suppose you never read such old out-of-date stuff, Miss Flora?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re wrong, Dr. Sheppard. I love _The Mill on the Floss_.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was rather pleased to hear it. The things young women read nowadays\\n\\nand profess to enjoy positively frighten me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You haven’t congratulated me yet, Dr. Sheppard,” said Flora. “Haven’t\\n\\nyou heard?”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe held out her left hand. On the third finger of it was an\\n\\nexquisitely set single pearl.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m going to marry Ralph, you know,” she went on. “Uncle is very\\n\\npleased. It keeps me in the family, you see.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI took both her hands in mine.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear,” I said, “I hope you’ll be very happy.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’ve been engaged for about a month,” continued Flora in her cool\\n\\nvoice, “but it was only announced yesterday. Uncle is going to do up\\n\\nCross-stones, and give it to us to live in, and we’re going to pretend\\n\\nto farm. Really, we shall hunt all the winter, town for the season, and\\n\\nthen go yachting. I love the sea. And, of course, I shall take a great\\n\\ninterest in the parish affairs, and attend all the Mothers’ Meetings.”\\n\\n\\n\\nJust then Mrs. Ackroyd rustled in, full of apologies for being late.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am sorry to say I detest Mrs. Ackroyd. She is all chains and teeth\\n\\nand bones. A most unpleasant woman. She has small pale flinty blue\\n\\neyes, and however gushing her words may be, those eyes of hers always\\n\\nremain coldly speculative.\\n\\n\\n\\nI went across to her, leaving Flora by the window. She gave me a\\n\\nhandful of assorted knuckles and rings to squeeze, and began talking\\n\\nvolubly.\\n\\n\\n\\nHad I heard about Flora’s engagement? So suitable in every way. The\\n\\ndear young things had fallen in love at first sight. Such a perfect\\n\\npair, he so dark and she so fair.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can’t tell you, my dear Dr. Sheppard, the relief to a mother’s\\n\\nheart.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd sighed—a tribute to her mother’s heart, whilst her eyes\\n\\nremained shrewdly observant of me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I was wondering. You are such an old friend of dear Roger’s. We\\n\\nknow how much he trusts to your judgment. So difficult for me—in\\n\\nmy position, as poor Cecil’s widow. But there are so many tiresome\\n\\nthings—settlements, you know—all that. I fully believe that Roger\\n\\nintends to make settlements upon dear Flora, but, as you know, he is\\n\\njust a _leetle_ peculiar about money. Very usual, I’ve heard, amongst\\n\\nmen who are captains of industry. I wondered, you know, if you could\\n\\njust _sound_ him on the subject? Flora is so fond of you. We feel you\\n\\nare quite an old friend, although we have only really known you just\\n\\nover two years.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd’s eloquence was cut short as the drawing-room door opened\\n\\nonce more. I was pleased at the interruption. I hate interfering in\\n\\nother people’s affairs, and I had not the least intention of tackling\\n\\nAckroyd on the subject of Flora’s settlements. In another moment I\\n\\nshould have been forced to tell Mrs. Ackroyd as much.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You know Major Blunt, don’t you, doctor?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\nA lot of people know Hector Blunt—at least by repute. He has shot more\\n\\nwild animals in unlikely places than any man living, I suppose. When\\n\\nyou mention him, people say: “Blunt—you don’t mean the big game man, do\\n\\nyou?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHis friendship with Ackroyd has always puzzled me a little. The two men\\n\\nare so totally dissimilar. Hector Blunt is perhaps five years Ackroyd’s\\n\\njunior. They made friends early in life, and though their ways have\\n\\ndiverged, the friendship still holds. About once in two years Blunt\\n\\nspends a fortnight at Fernly, and an immense animal’s head, with an\\n\\namazing number of horns which fixes you with a glazed stare as soon\\n\\nas you come inside the front door, is a permanent reminder of the\\n\\nfriendship.\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt had entered the room now with his own peculiar, deliberate, yet\\n\\nsoft-footed tread. He is a man of medium height, sturdily and rather\\n\\nstockily built. His face is almost mahogany-colored, and is peculiarly\\n\\nexpressionless. He has gray eyes that give the impression of always\\n\\nwatching something that is happening very far away. He talks little,\\n\\nand what he does say is said jerkily, as though the words were forced\\n\\nout of him unwillingly.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said now: “How are you, Sheppard?” in his usual abrupt fashion, and\\n\\nthen stood squarely in front of the fireplace looking over our heads as\\n\\nthough he saw something very interesting happening in Timbuctoo.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Major Blunt,” said Flora, “I wish you’d tell me about these African\\n\\nthings. I’m sure you know what they all are.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI have heard Hector Blunt described as a woman hater, but I noticed\\n\\nthat he joined Flora at the silver table with what might be described\\n\\nas alacrity. They bent over it together.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was afraid Mrs. Ackroyd would begin talking about settlements again,\\n\\nso I made a few hurried remarks about the new sweet pea. I knew there\\n\\nwas a new sweet pea because the _Daily Mail_ had told me so that\\n\\nmorning. Mrs. Ackroyd knows nothing about horticulture, but she is the\\n\\nkind of woman who likes to appear well-informed about the topics of the\\n\\nday, and she, too, reads the _Daily Mail_. We were able to converse\\n\\nquite intelligently until Ackroyd and his secretary joined us, and\\n\\nimmediately afterwards Parker announced dinner.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy place at table was between Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora. Blunt was on Mrs.\\n\\nAckroyd’s other side, and Geoffrey Raymond next to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nDinner was not a cheerful affair. Ackroyd was visibly preoccupied. He\\n\\nlooked wretched, and ate next to nothing. Mrs. Ackroyd, Raymond, and\\n\\nI kept the conversation going. Flora seemed affected by her uncle’s\\n\\ndepression, and Blunt relapsed into his usual taciturnity.\\n\\n\\n\\nImmediately after dinner Ackroyd slipped his arm through mine and led\\n\\nme off to his study.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Once we’ve had coffee, we shan’t be disturbed again,” he explained. “I\\n\\ntold Raymond to see to it that we shouldn’t be interrupted.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI studied him quietly without appearing to do so. He was clearly under\\n\\nthe influence of some strong excitement. For a minute or two he paced\\n\\nup and down the room, then, as Parker entered with the coffee tray, he\\n\\nsank into an arm-chair in front of the fire.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe study was a comfortable apartment. Book-shelves lined one wall of\\n\\nit. The chairs were big and covered in dark blue leather. A large desk\\n\\nstood by the window and was covered with papers neatly docketed and\\n\\nfiled. On a round table were various magazines and sporting papers.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve had a return of that pain after food lately,” remarked Ackroyd\\n\\ncasually, as he helped himself to coffee. “You must give me some more\\n\\nof those tablets of yours.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt struck me that he was anxious to convey the impression that our\\n\\nconference was a medical one. I played up accordingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thought as much. I brought some up with me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good man. Hand them over now.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“They’re in my bag in the hall. I’ll get them.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAckroyd arrested me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t you trouble. Parker will get them. Bring in the doctor’s bag,\\n\\nwill you, Parker?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very good, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker withdrew. As I was about to speak, Ackroyd threw up his hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not yet. Wait. Don’t you see I’m in such a state of nerves that I can\\n\\nhardly contain myself?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw that plainly enough. And I was very uneasy. All sorts of\\n\\nforebodings assailed me.\\n\\n\\n\\nAckroyd spoke again almost immediately.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Make certain that window’s closed, will you?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nSomewhat surprised, I got up and went to it. It was not a French\\n\\nwindow, but one of the ordinary sash type. The heavy blue velvet\\n\\ncurtains were drawn in front of it, but the window itself was open at\\n\\nthe top.\\n\\n\\n\\nParker reëntered the room with my bag while I was still at the window.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s all right,” I said, emerging again into the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’ve put the latch across?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, yes. What’s the matter with you, Ackroyd?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe door had just closed behind Parker, or I would not have put the\\n\\nquestion.\\n\\n\\n\\nAckroyd waited just a minute before replying.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m in hell,” he said slowly, after a minute. “No, don’t bother with\\n\\nthose damned tablets. I only said that for Parker. Servants are so\\n\\ncurious. Come here and sit down. The door’s closed too, isn’t it?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes. Nobody can overhear; don’t be uneasy.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sheppard, nobody knows what I’ve gone through in the last twenty-four\\n\\nhours. If a man’s house ever fell in ruins about him, mine has about\\n\\nme. This business of Ralph’s is the last straw. But we won’t talk about\\n\\nthat now. It’s the other—the other——! I don’t know what to do about it.\\n\\nAnd I’ve got to make up my mind soon.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s the trouble?”\\n\\n\\n\\nAckroyd remained silent for a minute or two. He seemed curiously averse\\n\\nto begin. When he did speak, the question he asked came as a complete\\n\\nsurprise. It was the last thing I expected.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sheppard, you attended Ashley Ferrars in his last illness, didn’t you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I did.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe seemed to find even greater difficulty in framing his next question.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did you never suspect—did it ever enter your head—that—well, that he\\n\\nmight have been poisoned?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was silent for a minute or two. Then I made up my mind what to say.\\n\\nRoger Ackroyd was not Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll tell you the truth,” I said. “At the time I had no suspicion\\n\\nwhatever, but since—well, it was mere idle talk on my sister’s part\\n\\nthat first put the idea into my head. Since then I haven’t been able to\\n\\nget it out again. But, mind you, I’ve no foundation whatever for that\\n\\nsuspicion.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He _was_ poisoned,” said Ackroyd.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe spoke in a dull heavy voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who by?” I asked sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“His wife.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How do you know that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She told me so herself.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“When?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yesterday! My God! yesterday! It seems ten years ago.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI waited a minute, and then he went on.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You understand, Sheppard, I’m telling you this in confidence. It’s to\\n\\ngo no further. I want your advice—I can’t carry the whole weight by\\n\\nmyself. As I said just now, I don’t know what to do.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Can you tell me the whole story?” I said. “I’m still in the dark. How\\n\\ndid Mrs. Ferrars come to make this confession to you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s like this. Three months ago I asked Mrs. Ferrars to marry me.\\n\\nShe refused. I asked her again and she consented, but she refused to\\n\\nallow me to make the engagement public until her year of mourning was\\n\\nup. Yesterday I called upon her, pointed out that a year and three\\n\\nweeks had now elapsed since her husband’s death, and that there could\\n\\nbe no further objection to making the engagement public property. I\\n\\nhad noticed that she had been very strange in her manner for some days.\\n\\nNow, suddenly, without the least warning, she broke down completely.\\n\\nShe—she told me everything. Her hatred of her brute of a husband, her\\n\\ngrowing love for me, and the—the dreadful means she had taken. Poison!\\n\\nMy God! It was murder in cold blood.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw the repulsion, the horror, in Ackroyd’s face. So Mrs. Ferrars\\n\\nmust have seen it. Ackroyd is not the type of the great lover who can\\n\\nforgive all for love’s sake. He is fundamentally a good citizen. All\\n\\nthat was sound and wholesome and law-abiding in him must have turned\\n\\nfrom her utterly in that moment of revelation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” he went on, in a low, monotonous voice, “she confessed\\n\\neverything. It seems that there is one person who has known all\\n\\nalong—who has been blackmailing her for huge sums. It was the strain of\\n\\nthat that drove her nearly mad.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who was the man?”\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly before my eyes there arose the picture of Ralph Paton and Mrs.\\n\\nFerrars side by side. Their heads so close together. I felt a momentary\\n\\nthrob of anxiety. Supposing—oh! but surely that was impossible. I\\n\\nremembered the frankness of Ralph’s greeting that very afternoon.\\n\\nAbsurd!\\n\\n\\n\\n“She wouldn’t tell me his name,” said Ackroyd slowly. “As a matter of\\n\\nfact, she didn’t actually say that it was a man. But of course——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course,” I agreed. “It must have been a man. And you’ve no\\n\\nsuspicion at all?”\\n\\n\\n\\nFor answer Ackroyd groaned and dropped his head into his hands.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It can’t be,” he said. “I’m mad even to think of such a thing. No, I\\n\\nwon’t even admit to you the wild suspicion that crossed my mind. I’ll\\n\\ntell you this much, though. Something she said made me think that the\\n\\nperson in question might be actually among my household—but that can’t\\n\\nbe so. I must have misunderstood her.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What did you say to her?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What could I say? She saw, of course, the awful shock it had been to\\n\\nme. And then there was the question, what was my duty in the matter?\\n\\nShe had made me, you see, an accessory after the fact. She saw all\\n\\nthat, I think, quicker than I did. I was stunned, you know. She asked\\n\\nme for twenty-four hours—made me promise to do nothing till the end\\n\\nof that time. And she steadfastly refused to give me the name of the\\n\\nscoundrel who had been blackmailing her. I suppose she was afraid that\\n\\nI might go straight off and hammer him, and then the fat would have\\n\\nbeen in the fire as far as she was concerned. She told me that I should\\n\\nhear from her before twenty-four hours had passed. My God! I swear to\\n\\nyou, Sheppard, that it never entered my head what she meant to do.\\n\\nSuicide! And I drove her to it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, no,” I said. “Don’t take an exaggerated view of things. The\\n\\nresponsibility for her death doesn’t lie at your door.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The question is, what am I to do now? The poor lady is dead. Why rake\\n\\nup past trouble?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I rather agree with you,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But there’s another point. How am I to get hold of that scoundrel who\\n\\ndrove her to death as surely as if he’d killed her. He knew of the\\n\\nfirst crime, and he fastened on to it like some obscene vulture. She’s\\n\\npaid the penalty. Is he to go scot-free?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I see,” I said slowly. “You want to hunt him down? It will mean a lot\\n\\nof publicity, you know.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I’ve thought of that. I’ve zigzagged to and fro in my mind.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I agree with you that the villain ought to be punished, but the cost\\n\\nhas got to be reckoned.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAckroyd rose and walked up and down. Presently he sank into the chair\\n\\nagain.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Look here, Sheppard, suppose we leave it like this. If no word comes\\n\\nfrom her, we’ll let the dead things lie.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean by word coming from her?” I asked curiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have the strongest impression that somewhere or somehow she must\\n\\nhave left a message for me—before she went. I can’t argue about it, but\\n\\nthere it is.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“She left no letter or word of any kind. I asked.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sheppard, I’m convinced that she did. And more, I’ve a feeling that by\\n\\ndeliberately choosing death, she wanted the whole thing to come out, if\\n\\nonly to be revenged on the man who drove her to desperation. I believe\\n\\nthat if I could have seen her then, she would have told me his name and\\n\\nbid me go for him for all I was worth.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked at me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don’t believe in impressions?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, I do, in a sense. If, as you put it, word should come from\\n\\nher——”\\n\\n\\n\\nI broke off. The door opened noiselessly and Parker entered with a\\n\\nsalver on which were some letters.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The evening post, sir,” he said, handing the salver to Ackroyd.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he collected the coffee cups and withdrew.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy attention, diverted for a moment, came back to Ackroyd. He was\\n\\nstaring like a man turned to stone at a long blue envelope. The other\\n\\nletters he had let drop to the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Her writing_,” he said in a whisper. “She must have gone out and\\n\\nposted it last night, just before—before——”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe ripped open the envelope and drew out a thick enclosure. Then he\\n\\nlooked up sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re sure you shut the window?” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite sure,” I said, surprised. “Why?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“All this evening I’ve had a queer feeling of being watched, spied\\n\\nupon. What’s that——?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe turned sharply. So did I. We both had the impression of hearing the\\n\\nlatch of the door give ever so slightly. I went across to it and opened\\n\\nit. There was no one there.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nerves,” murmured Ackroyd to himself.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe unfolded the thick sheets of paper, and read aloud in a low voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n  “_My dear, my very dear Roger,—A life calls for a life. I see\\n\\n  that—I saw it in your face this afternoon. So I am taking the only\\n\\n  road open to me. I leave to you the punishment of the person who\\n\\n  has made my life a hell upon earth for the last year. I would not\\n\\n  tell you the name this afternoon, but I propose to write it to you\\n\\n  now. I have no children or near relations to be spared, so do not\\n\\n  fear publicity. If you can, Roger, my very dear Roger, forgive me\\n\\n  the wrong I meant to do you, since when the time came, I could not\\n\\n  do it after all...._”\\n\\n\\n\\nAckroyd, his finger on the sheet to turn it over, paused.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sheppard, forgive me, but I must read this alone,” he said unsteadily.\\n\\n“It was meant for my eyes, and my eyes only.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe put the letter in the envelope and laid it on the table.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Later, when I am alone.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” I cried impulsively, “read it now.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAckroyd stared at me in some surprise.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I beg your pardon,” I said, reddening. “I do not mean read it aloud to\\n\\nme. But read it through whilst I am still here.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAckroyd shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, I’d rather wait.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBut for some reason, obscure to myself, I continued to urge him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“At least, read the name of the man,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow Ackroyd is essentially pig-headed. The more you urge him to do a\\n\\nthing, the more determined he is not to do it. All my arguments were in\\n\\nvain.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe letter had been brought in at twenty minutes to nine. It was just\\n\\non ten minutes to nine when I left him, the letter still unread. I\\n\\nhesitated with my hand on the door handle, looking back and wondering\\n\\nif there was anything I had left undone. I could think of nothing. With\\n\\na shake of the head I passed out and closed the door behind me.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was startled by seeing the figure of Parker close at hand. He looked\\n\\nembarrassed, and it occurred to me that he might have been listening at\\n\\nthe door.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat a fat, smug, oily face the man had, and surely there was something\\n\\ndecidedly shifty in his eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Ackroyd particularly does not want to be disturbed,” I said\\n\\ncoldly. “He told me to tell you so.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite so, sir. I—I fancied I heard the bell ring.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was such a palpable untruth that I did not trouble to reply.\\n\\nPreceding me to the hall, Parker helped me on with my overcoat, and I\\n\\nstepped out into the night. The moon was overcast and everything seemed\\n\\nvery dark and still. The village church clock chimed nine o’clock\\n\\nas I passed through the lodge gates. I turned to the left towards\\n\\nthe village, and almost cannoned into a man coming in the opposite\\n\\ndirection.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This the way to Fernly Park, mister?” asked the stranger in a hoarse\\n\\nvoice.\\n\\n\\n\\nI looked at him. He was wearing a hat pulled down over his eyes, and\\n\\nhis coat collar turned up. I could see little or nothing of his face,\\n\\nbut he seemed a young fellow. The voice was rough and uneducated.\\n\\n\\n\\n“These are the lodge gates here,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, mister.” He paused, and then added, quite unnecessarily,\\n\\n“I’m a stranger in these parts, you see.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe went on, passing through the gates as I turned to look after him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe odd thing was that his voice reminded me of some one’s voice that I\\n\\nknew, but whose it was I could not think.\\n\\n\\n\\nTen minutes later I was at home once more. Caroline was full of\\n\\ncuriosity to know why I had returned so early. I had to make up a\\n\\nslightly fictitious account of the evening in order to satisfy her, and\\n\\nI had an uneasy feeling that she saw through the transparent device.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt ten o’clock I rose, yawned, and suggested bed. Caroline acquiesced.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Friday night, and on Friday night I wind the clocks. I did it as\\n\\nusual, whilst Caroline satisfied herself that the servants had locked\\n\\nup the kitchen properly.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a quarter past ten as we went up the stairs. I had just reached\\n\\nthe top when the telephone rang in the hall below.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. Bates,” said Caroline immediately.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m afraid so,” I said ruefully.\\n\\n\\n\\nI ran down the stairs and took up the receiver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What?” I said. “_What?_ Certainly, I’ll come at once.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI ran upstairs, caught up my bag, and stuffed a few extra dressings\\n\\ninto it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Parker telephoning,” I shouted to Caroline, “from Fernly. They’ve just\\n\\nfound Roger Ackroyd murdered.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               CHAPTER V\\n\\n\\n\\n                                MURDER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI got out the car in next to no time, and drove rapidly to Fernly.\\n\\nJumping out, I pulled the bell impatiently. There was some delay in\\n\\nanswering, and I rang again.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen I heard the rattle of the chain and Parker, his impassivity of\\n\\ncountenance quite unmoved, stood in the open doorway.\\n\\n\\n\\nI pushed past him into the hall.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where is he?” I demanded sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, sir?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your master. Mr. Ackroyd. Don’t stand there staring at me, man. Have\\n\\nyou notified the police?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The police, sir? Did you say the police?” Parker stared at me as\\n\\nthough I were a ghost.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s the matter with you, Parker? If, as you say, your master has\\n\\nbeen murdered——”\\n\\n\\n\\nA gasp broke from Parker.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The master? Murdered? Impossible, sir!”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was my turn to stare.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Didn’t you telephone to me, not five minutes ago, and tell me that Mr.\\n\\nAckroyd had been found murdered?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Me, sir? Oh! no indeed, sir. I wouldn’t dream of doing such a thing.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you mean to say it’s all a hoax? That there’s nothing the matter\\n\\nwith Mr. Ackroyd?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Excuse me, sir, did the person telephoning use my name?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll give you the exact words I heard. ‘_Is that Dr. Sheppard? Parker,\\n\\nthe butler at Fernly, speaking. Will you please come at once, sir. Mr.\\n\\nAckroyd has been murdered._’”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker and I stared at each other blankly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A very wicked joke to play, sir,” he said at last, in a shocked tone.\\n\\n“Fancy saying a thing like that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where is Mr. Ackroyd?” I asked suddenly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Still in the study, I fancy, sir. The ladies have gone to bed, and\\n\\nMajor Blunt and Mr. Raymond are in the billiard room.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think I’ll just look in and see him for a minute,” I said. “I know\\n\\nhe didn’t want to be disturbed again, but this odd practical joke has\\n\\nmade me uneasy. I’d just like to satisfy myself that he’s all right.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite so, sir. It makes me feel quite uneasy myself. If you don’t\\n\\nobject to my accompanying you as far as the door, sir——?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not at all,” I said. “Come along.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI passed through the door on the right, Parker on my heels, traversed\\n\\nthe little lobby where a small flight of stairs led upstairs to\\n\\nAckroyd’s bedroom, and tapped on the study door.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no answer. I turned the handle, but the door was locked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Allow me, sir,” said Parker.\\n\\n\\n\\nVery nimbly, for a man of his build, he dropped on one knee and applied\\n\\nhis eye to the keyhole.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Key is in the lock all right, sir,” he said, rising. “On the inside.\\n\\nMr. Ackroyd must have locked himself in and possibly just dropped off\\n\\nto sleep.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI bent down and verified Parker’s statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It seems all right,” I said, “but, all the same, Parker, I’m going\\n\\nto wake your master up. I shouldn’t be satisfied to go home without\\n\\nhearing from his own lips that he’s quite all right.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSo saying, I rattled the handle and called out, “Ackroyd, Ackroyd, just\\n\\na minute.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBut still there was no answer. I glanced over my shoulder.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t want to alarm the household,” I said hesitatingly.\\n\\n\\n\\nParker went across and shut the door from the big hall through which we\\n\\nhad come.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think that will be all right now, sir. The billiard room is at\\n\\nthe other side of the house, and so are the kitchen quarters and the\\n\\nladies’ bedrooms.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI nodded comprehendingly. Then I banged once more frantically on the\\n\\ndoor, and stooping down, fairly bawled through the keyhole:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ackroyd, Ackroyd! It’s Sheppard. Let me in.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd still—silence. Not a sign of life from within the locked room.\\n\\nParker and I glanced at each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Look here, Parker,” I said, “I’m going to break this door in—or\\n\\nrather, we are. I’ll take the responsibility.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you say so, sir,” said Parker, rather doubtfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I do say so. I’m seriously alarmed about Mr. Ackroyd.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI looked round the small lobby and picked up a heavy oak chair. Parker\\n\\nand I held it between us and advanced to the assault. Once, twice, and\\n\\nthree times we hurled it against the lock. At the third blow it gave,\\n\\nand we staggered into the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nAckroyd was sitting as I had left him in the arm-chair before the fire.\\n\\nHis head had fallen sideways, and clearly visible, just below the\\n\\ncollar of his coat, was a shining piece of twisted metalwork.\\n\\n\\n\\nParker and I advanced till we stood over the recumbent figure. I heard\\n\\nthe butler draw in his breath with a sharp hiss.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Stabbed from be’ind,” he murmured. “’Orrible!”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe wiped his moist brow with his handkerchief, then stretched out a\\n\\nhand gingerly towards the hilt of the dagger.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You mustn’t touch that,” I said sharply. “Go at once to the telephone\\n\\nand ring up the police station. Inform them of what has happened. Then\\n\\ntell Mr. Raymond and Major Blunt.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very good, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker hurried away, still wiping his perspiring brow.\\n\\n\\n\\nI did what little had to be done. I was careful not to disturb the\\n\\nposition of the body, and not to handle the dagger at all. No object\\n\\nwas to be attained by moving it. Ackroyd had clearly been dead some\\n\\nlittle time.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen I heard young Raymond’s voice, horror-stricken and incredulous,\\n\\noutside.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What do you say? Oh! impossible! Where’s the doctor?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe appeared impetuously in the doorway, then stopped dead, his face\\n\\nvery white. A hand put him aside, and Hector Blunt came past him into\\n\\nthe room.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My God!” said Raymond from behind him; “it’s true, then.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt came straight on till he reached the chair. He bent over the\\n\\nbody, and I thought that, like Parker, he was going to lay hold of the\\n\\ndagger hilt. I drew him back with one hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing must be moved,” I explained. “The police must see him exactly\\n\\nas he is now.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt nodded in instant comprehension. His face was expressionless as\\n\\never, but I thought I detected signs of emotion beneath the stolid\\n\\nmask. Geoffrey Raymond had joined us now, and stood peering over\\n\\nBlunt’s shoulder at the body.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This is terrible,” he said in a low voice.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had regained his composure, but as he took off the pince-nez he\\n\\nhabitually wore and polished them I observed that his hand was shaking.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Robbery, I suppose,” he said. “How did the fellow get in? Through the\\n\\nwindow? Has anything been taken?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe went towards the desk.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You think it’s burglary?” I said slowly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What else could it be? There’s no question of suicide, I suppose?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No man could stab himself in such a way,” I said confidently. “It’s\\n\\nmurder right enough. But with what motive?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Roger hadn’t an enemy in the world,” said Blunt quietly. “Must have\\n\\nbeen burglars. But what was the thief after? Nothing seems to be\\n\\ndisarranged?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked round the room. Raymond was still sorting the papers on the\\n\\ndesk.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There seems nothing missing, and none of the drawers show signs of\\n\\nhaving been tampered with,” the secretary observed at last. “It’s very\\n\\nmysterious.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt made a slight motion with his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There are some letters on the floor here,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nI looked down. Three or four letters still lay where Ackroyd had\\n\\ndropped them earlier in the evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the blue envelope containing Mrs. Ferrars’s letter had disappeared.\\n\\nI half opened my mouth to speak, but at that moment the sound of a bell\\n\\npealed through the house. There was a confused murmur of voices in the\\n\\nhall, and then Parker appeared with our local inspector and a police\\n\\nconstable.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good evening, gentlemen,” said the inspector. “I’m terribly sorry for\\n\\nthis! A good kind gentleman like Mr. Ackroyd. The butler says it is\\n\\nmurder. No possibility of accident or suicide, doctor?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“None whatever,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! A bad business.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe came and stood over the body.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Been moved at all?” he asked sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Beyond making certain that life was extinct—an easy matter—I have not\\n\\ndisturbed the body in any way.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! And everything points to the murderer having got clear away—for\\n\\nthe moment, that is. Now then, let me hear all about it. Who found the\\n\\nbody?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI explained the circumstances carefully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A telephone message, you say? From the butler?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A message that I never sent,” declared Parker earnestly. “I’ve not\\n\\nbeen near the telephone the whole evening. The others can bear me out\\n\\nthat I haven’t.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very odd, that. Did it sound like Parker’s voice, doctor?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well—I can’t say I noticed. I took it for granted, you see.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Naturally. Well, you got up here, broke in the door, and found poor\\n\\nMr. Ackroyd like this. How long should you say he had been dead,\\n\\ndoctor?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Half an hour at least—perhaps longer,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The door was locked on the inside, you say? What about the window?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I myself closed and bolted it earlier in the evening at Mr. Ackroyd’s\\n\\nrequest.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector strode across to it and threw back the curtains.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, it’s open now anyway,” he remarked.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrue enough, the window was open, the lower sash being raised to its\\n\\nfullest extent.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector produced a pocket torch and flashed it along the sill\\n\\noutside.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This is the way he went all right,” he remarked, “_and_ got in. See\\n\\nhere.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the light of the powerful torch, several clearly defined footmarks\\n\\ncould be seen. They seemed to be those of shoes with rubber studs\\n\\nin the soles. One particularly clear one pointed inwards, another,\\n\\nslightly overlapping it, pointed outwards.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Plain as a pikestaff,” said the inspector. “Any valuables missing?”\\n\\n\\n\\nGeoffrey Raymond shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not so that we can discover. Mr. Ackroyd never kept anything of\\n\\nparticular value in this room.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“H’m,” said the inspector. “Man found an open window. Climbed in, saw\\n\\nMr. Ackroyd sitting there—maybe he’d fallen asleep. Man stabbed him\\n\\nfrom behind, then lost his nerve and made off. But he’s left his tracks\\n\\npretty clearly. We ought to get hold of _him_ without much difficulty.\\n\\nNo suspicious strangers been hanging about anywhere?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh!” I said suddenly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is it, doctor?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I met a man this evening—just as I was turning out of the gate. He\\n\\nasked me the way to Fernly Park.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What time would that be?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just nine o’clock. I heard it chime the hour as I was turning out of\\n\\nthe gate.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Can you describe him?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI did so to the best of my ability.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector turned to the butler.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Any one answering that description come to the front door?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, sir. No one has been to the house at all this evening.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What about the back?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t think so, sir, but I’ll make inquiries.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe moved towards the door, but the inspector held up a large hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, thanks. I’ll do my own inquiring. But first of all I want to fix\\n\\nthe time a little more clearly. When was Mr. Ackroyd last seen alive?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Probably by me,” I said, “when I left at—let me see—about ten minutes\\n\\nto nine. He told me that he didn’t wish to be disturbed, and I repeated\\n\\nthe order to Parker.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just so, sir,” said Parker respectfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Ackroyd was certainly alive at half-past nine,” put in Raymond,\\n\\n“for I heard his voice in here talking.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who was he talking to?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That I don’t know. Of course, at the time I took it for granted that\\n\\nit was Dr. Sheppard who was with him. I wanted to ask him a question\\n\\nabout some papers I was engaged upon, but when I heard the voices I\\n\\nremembered that he had said he wanted to talk to Dr. Sheppard without\\n\\nbeing disturbed, and I went away again. But now it seems that the\\n\\ndoctor had already left?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I was at home by a quarter-past nine,” I said. “I didn’t go out again\\n\\nuntil I received the telephone call.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who could have been with him at half-past nine?” queried the\\n\\ninspector. “It wasn’t you, Mr.—er——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Major Blunt,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Major Hector Blunt?” asked the inspector, a respectful tone creeping\\n\\ninto his voice.\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt merely jerked his head affirmatively.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think we’ve seen you down here before, sir,” said the inspector.\\n\\n“I didn’t recognize you for the moment, but you were staying with Mr.\\n\\nAckroyd a year ago last May.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“June,” corrected Blunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just so, June it was. Now, as I was saying, it wasn’t you with Mr.\\n\\nAckroyd at nine-thirty this evening?”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Never saw him after dinner,” he volunteered.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector turned once more to Raymond.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You didn’t overhear any of the conversation going on, did you, sir?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I did catch just a fragment of it,” said the secretary, “and,\\n\\nsupposing as I did that it was Dr. Sheppard who was with Mr. Ackroyd,\\n\\nthat fragment struck me as distinctly odd. As far as I can remember,\\n\\nthe exact words were these. Mr. Ackroyd was speaking. ‘The calls\\n\\non my purse have been so frequent of late’—that is what he was\\n\\nsaying—‘of late, that I fear it is impossible for me to accede to your\\n\\nrequest....’ I went away again at once, of course, so did not hear any\\n\\nmore. But I rather wondered because Dr. Sheppard——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“——Does not ask for loans for himself or subscriptions for others,” I\\n\\nfinished.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A demand for money,” said the inspector musingly. “It may be that here\\n\\nwe have a very important clew.” He turned to the butler. “You say,\\n\\nParker, that nobody was admitted by the front door this evening?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s what I say, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then it seems almost certain that Mr. Ackroyd himself must have\\n\\nadmitted this stranger. But I don’t quite see——”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector went into a kind of day-dream for some minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One thing’s clear,” he said at length, rousing himself from his\\n\\nabsorption. “Mr. Ackroyd was alive and well at nine-thirty. That is the\\n\\nlast moment at which he is known to have been alive.”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker gave vent to an apologetic cough which brought the inspector’s\\n\\neyes on him at once.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well?” he said sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you’ll excuse me, sir, Miss Flora saw him after that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Miss Flora?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir. About a quarter to ten that would be. It was after that that\\n\\nshe told me Mr. Ackroyd wasn’t to be disturbed again to-night.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did he send her to you with that message?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not exactly, sir. I was bringing a tray with soda and whisky when Miss\\n\\nFlora, who was just coming out of this room, stopped me and said her\\n\\nuncle didn’t want to be disturbed.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector looked at the butler with rather closer attention than he\\n\\nhad bestowed on him up to now.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’d already been told that Mr. Ackroyd didn’t want to be disturbed,\\n\\nhadn’t you?”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker began to stammer. His hands shook.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Quite so, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And yet you were proposing to do so?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’d forgotten, sir. At least I mean, I always bring the whisky and\\n\\nsoda about that time, sir, and ask if there’s anything more, and I\\n\\nthought—well, I was doing as usual without thinking.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was at this moment that it began to dawn upon me that Parker was\\n\\nmost suspiciously flustered. The man was shaking and twitching all over.\\n\\n\\n\\n“H’m,” said the inspector. “I must see Miss Ackroyd at once. For the\\n\\nmoment we’ll leave this room exactly as it is. I can return here after\\n\\nI’ve heard what Miss Ackroyd has to tell me. I shall just take the\\n\\nprecaution of shutting and bolting the window.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis precaution accomplished, he led the way into the hall and we\\n\\nfollowed him. He paused a moment, as he glanced up at the little\\n\\nstaircase, then spoke over his shoulder to the constable.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Jones, you’d better stay here. Don’t let any one go into that room.”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker interposed deferentially.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you’ll excuse me, sir. If you were to lock the door into the main\\n\\nhall, nobody could gain access to this part. That staircase leads only\\n\\nto Mr. Ackroyd’s bedroom and bathroom. There is no communication with\\n\\nthe other part of the house. There once was a door through, but Mr.\\n\\nAckroyd had it blocked up. He liked to feel that his suite was entirely\\n\\nprivate.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTo make things clear and explain the position, I have appended a rough\\n\\nsketch of the right-hand wing of the house. The small staircase leads,\\n\\nas Parker explained, to a big bedroom (made by two being knocked into\\n\\none) and an adjoining bathroom and lavatory.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n\\n\\n  +------------------------------------.\\n\\n  |             TERRACE                 .\\n\\n  |--==--+--==---==--+---==---==----+    .\\n\\n  |PANTRY|   DINING  |    DRAWING   |    .\\n\\n  |      |    ROOM   |     ROOM     |    .\\n\\n  |      |           |              |    .\\n\\n  |___/ _+___/ __/  _+_/ +__________+    .\\n\\n  |                      |          |    .\\n\\n  |___  ___+____+         \\\\STAIRS‖‖‖|    .\\n\\n  |   \\\\    |====|        +-- /------+    .\\n\\n  |        |====|        |          |    .\\n\\n  |BILLIARD|====|  HALL  |          |    .\\n\\n  |  ROOM  |====|        |  STUDY   ‖    .\\n\\n  |        +----+        |          ‖    .\\n\\n  |        |STAIRCASE    |          |    .\\n\\n  |        |             |          |    .\\n\\n  |       \\\\              |          |    .\\n\\n  +-==-==--+-------+  +--+----------+-  -+\\n\\n                   |  |              .  .\\n\\n                FRONT DOOR          .  .\\n\\n                 .      .          .  .\\n\\n                 .      .         .  .\\n\\n                  .    .         .  .\\n\\n                   .  .

We went through into\\n\\nthe large hall and he locked the door behind him, slipping the key into\\n\\nhis pocket. Then he gave the constable some low-voiced instructions,\\n\\nand the latter prepared to depart.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We must get busy on those shoe tracks,” explained the inspector. “But\\n\\nfirst of all, I must have a word with Miss Ackroyd. She was the last\\n\\nperson to see her uncle alive. Does she know yet?”\\n\\n\\n\\nRaymond shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, no need to tell her for another five minutes. She can answer my\\n\\nquestions better without being upset by knowing the truth about her\\n\\nuncle. Tell her there’s been a burglary, and ask her if she would mind\\n\\ndressing and coming down to answer a few questions.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Raymond who went upstairs on this errand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Miss Ackroyd will be down in a minute,” he said, when he returned. “I\\n\\ntold her just what you suggested.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIn less than five minutes Flora descended the staircase. She was\\n\\nwrapped in a pale pink silk kimono. She looked anxious and excited.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector stepped forward.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good-evening, Miss Ackroyd,” he said civilly. “We’re afraid there’s\\n\\nbeen an attempt at robbery, and we want you to help us. What’s this\\n\\nroom—the billiard room? Come in here and sit down.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora sat down composedly on the wide divan which ran the length of the\\n\\nwall, and looked up at the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t quite understand. What has been stolen? What do you want me to\\n\\ntell you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s just this, Miss Ackroyd. Parker here says you came out of your\\n\\nuncle’s study at about a quarter to ten. Is that right?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite right. I had been to say good-night to him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And the time is correct?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, it must have been about then. I can’t say exactly. It might have\\n\\nbeen later.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Was your uncle alone, or was there any one with him?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He was alone. Dr. Sheppard had gone.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did you happen to notice whether the window was open or shut?”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora shook her head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can’t say. The curtains were drawn.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Exactly. And your uncle seemed quite as usual?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think so.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you mind telling us exactly what passed between you?”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora paused a minute, as though to collect her recollections.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I went in and said, ‘Good-night, uncle, I’m going to bed now. I’m\\n\\ntired to-night.’ He gave a sort of grunt, and—I went over and kissed\\n\\nhim, and he said something about my looking nice in the frock I had on,\\n\\nand then he told me to run away as he was busy. So I went.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did he ask specially not to be disturbed?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! yes, I forgot. He said: ‘Tell Parker I don’t want anything more\\n\\nto-night, and that he’s not to disturb me.’ I met Parker just outside\\n\\nthe door and gave him uncle’s message.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just so,” said the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Won’t you tell me what it is that has been stolen?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’re not quite—certain,” said the inspector hesitatingly.\\n\\n\\n\\nA wide look of alarm came into the girl’s eyes. She started up.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is it? You’re hiding something from me?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMoving in his usual unobtrusive manner, Hector Blunt came between her\\n\\nand the inspector. She half stretched out her hand, and he took it in\\n\\nboth of his, patting it as though she were a very small child, and she\\n\\nturned to him as though something in his stolid, rocklike demeanor\\n\\npromised comfort and safety.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s bad news, Flora,” he said quietly. “Bad news for all of us. Your\\n\\nUncle Roger——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It will be a shock to you. Bound to be. Poor Roger’s dead.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora drew away from him, her eyes dilating with horror.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When?” she whispered. “When?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very soon after you left him, I’m afraid,” said Blunt gravely.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora raised her hand to her throat, gave a little cry, and I hurried\\n\\nto catch her as she fell. She had fainted, and Blunt and I carried her\\n\\nupstairs and laid her on her bed. Then I got him to wake Mrs. Ackroyd\\n\\nand tell her the news. Flora soon revived, and I brought her mother to\\n\\nher, telling her what to do for the girl. Then I hurried downstairs\\n\\nagain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\n\\n                          THE TUNISIAN DAGGER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI met the inspector just coming from the door which led into the\\n\\nkitchen quarters.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How’s the young lady, doctor?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Coming round nicely. Her mother’s with her.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s good. I’ve been questioning the servants. They all declare that\\n\\nno one has been to the back door to-night. Your description of that\\n\\nstranger was rather vague. Can’t you give us something more definite to\\n\\ngo upon?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m afraid not,” I said regretfully. “It was a dark night, you see,\\n\\nand the fellow had his coat collar well pulled up and his hat squashed\\n\\ndown over his eyes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“H’m,” said the inspector. “Looked as though he wanted to conceal his\\n\\nface. Sure it was no one you know?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI replied in the negative, but not as decidedly as I might have done. I\\n\\nremembered my impression that the stranger’s voice was not unfamiliar\\n\\nto me. I explained this rather haltingly to the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was a rough, uneducated voice, you say?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI agreed, but it occurred to me that the roughness had been of an\\n\\nalmost exaggerated quality. If, as the inspector thought, the man had\\n\\nwished to hide his face, he might equally well have tried to disguise\\n\\nhis voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you mind coming into the study with me again, doctor? There are one\\n\\nor two things I want to ask you.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI acquiesced. Inspector Davis unlocked the door of the lobby, we passed\\n\\nthrough, and he locked the door again behind him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We don’t want to be disturbed,” he said grimly. “And we don’t want any\\n\\neavesdropping either. What’s all this about blackmail?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Blackmail!” I exclaimed, very much startled.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is it an effort of Parker’s imagination? Or is there something in it?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If Parker heard anything about blackmail,” I said slowly, “he must\\n\\nhave been listening outside this door with his ear glued against the\\n\\nkeyhole.”\\n\\n\\n\\nDavis nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing more likely. You see, I’ve been instituting a few inquiries as\\n\\nto what Parker has been doing with himself this evening. To tell the\\n\\ntruth, I didn’t like his manner. The man knows something. When I began\\n\\nto question him, he got the wind up, and plumped out some garbled story\\n\\nof blackmail.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI took an instant decision.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m rather glad you’ve brought the matter up,” I said. “I’ve been\\n\\ntrying to decide whether to make a clean breast of things or not. I’d\\n\\nalready practically decided to tell you everything, but I was going to\\n\\nwait for a favorable opportunity. You might as well have it now.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then and there I narrated the whole events of the evening as I\\n\\nhave set them down here. The inspector listened keenly, occasionally\\n\\ninterjecting a question.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Most extraordinary story I ever heard,” he said, when I had finished.\\n\\n“And you say that letter has completely disappeared? It looks bad—it\\n\\nlooks very bad indeed. It gives us what we’ve been looking for—a motive\\n\\nfor the murder.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I realize that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You say that Mr. Ackroyd hinted at a suspicion he had that some member\\n\\nof his household was involved? Household’s rather an elastic term.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don’t think that Parker himself might be the man we’re after?” I\\n\\nsuggested.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It looks very like it. He was obviously listening at the door when\\n\\nyou came out. Then Miss Ackroyd came across him later bent on entering\\n\\nthe study. Say he tried again when she was safely out of the way. He\\n\\nstabbed Ackroyd, locked the door on the inside, opened the window, and\\n\\ngot out that way, and went round to a side door which he had previously\\n\\nleft open. How’s that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s only one thing against it,” I said slowly. “If Ackroyd went on\\n\\nreading that letter as soon as I left, as he intended to do, I don’t\\n\\nsee him continuing to sit on here and turn things over in his mind for\\n\\nanother hour. He’d have had Parker in at once, accused him then and\\n\\nthere, and there would have been a fine old uproar. Remember, Ackroyd\\n\\nwas a man of choleric temper.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mightn’t have had time to go on with the letter just then,” suggested\\n\\nthe inspector. “We know some one was with him at half-past nine. If\\n\\nthat visitor turned up as soon as you left, and after he went, Miss\\n\\nAckroyd came in to say good-night—well, he wouldn’t be able to go on\\n\\nwith the letter until close upon ten o’clock.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And the telephone call?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Parker sent that all right—perhaps before he thought of the locked\\n\\ndoor and open window. Then he changed his mind—or got in a panic—and\\n\\ndecided to deny all knowledge of it. That was it, depend upon it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ye-es,” I said rather doubtfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Anyway, we can find out the truth about the telephone call from the\\n\\nexchange. If it was put through from here, I don’t see how any one\\n\\nelse but Parker could have sent it. Depend upon it, he’s our man.\\n\\nBut keep it dark—we don’t want to alarm him just yet, till we’ve got\\n\\nall the evidence. I’ll see to it he doesn’t give us the slip. To all\\n\\nappearances we’ll be concentrating on your mysterious stranger.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe rose from where he had been sitting astride the chair belonging to\\n\\nthe desk, and crossed over to the still form in the arm-chair.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The weapon ought to give us a clew,” he remarked, looking up. “It’s\\n\\nsomething quite unique—a curio, I should think, by the look of it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe bent down, surveying the handle attentively, and I heard him give a\\n\\ngrunt of satisfaction. Then, very gingerly, he pressed his hands down\\n\\nbelow the hilt and drew the blade out from the wound. Still carrying it\\n\\nso as not to touch the handle, he placed it in a wide china mug which\\n\\nadorned the mantelpiece.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, nodding at it. “Quite a work of art. There can’t be\\n\\nmany of them about.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was indeed a beautiful object. A narrow, tapering blade, and a hilt\\n\\nof elaborately intertwined metals of curious and careful workmanship.\\n\\nHe touched the blade gingerly with his finger, testing its sharpness,\\n\\nand made an appreciative grimace.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Lord, what an edge,” he exclaimed. “A child could drive that into a\\n\\nman—as easy as cutting butter. A dangerous sort of toy to have about.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“May I examine the body properly now?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Go ahead.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI made a thorough examination.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well?” said the inspector, when I had finished.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll spare you the technical language,” I said. “We’ll keep that\\n\\nfor the inquest. The blow was delivered by a right-handed man\\n\\nstanding behind him, and death must have been instantaneous. By the\\n\\nexpression on the dead man’s face, I should say that the blow was quite\\n\\nunexpected. He probably died without knowing who his assailant was.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Butlers can creep about as soft-footed as cats,” said Inspector Davis.\\n\\n“There’s not going to be much mystery about this crime. Take a look at\\n\\nthe hilt of that dagger.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI took the look.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I dare say they’re not apparent to you, but I can see them clearly\\n\\nenough.” He lowered his voice. “_Fingerprints!_”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stood off a few steps to judge of his effect.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I said mildly. “I guessed that.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI do not see why I should be supposed to be totally devoid of\\n\\nintelligence. After all, I read detective stories, and the newspapers,\\n\\nand am a man of quite average ability. If there had been toe marks on\\n\\nthe dagger handle, now, that would have been quite a different thing. I\\n\\nwould then have registered any amount of surprise and awe.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think the inspector was annoyed with me for declining to get\\n\\nthrilled. He picked up the china mug and invited me to accompany him to\\n\\nthe billiard room.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I want to see if Mr. Raymond can tell us anything about this dagger,”\\n\\nhe explained.\\n\\n\\n\\nLocking the outer door behind us again, we made our way to the billiard\\n\\nroom, where we found Geoffrey Raymond. The inspector held up his\\n\\nexhibit.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ever seen this before, Mr. Raymond?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why—I believe—I’m almost sure that is a curio given to Mr. Ackroyd\\n\\nby Major Blunt. It comes from Morocco—no, Tunis. So the crime was\\n\\ncommitted with that? What an extraordinary thing. It seems almost\\n\\nimpossible, and yet there could hardly be two daggers the same. May I\\n\\nfetch Major Blunt?”\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout waiting for an answer, he hurried off.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nice young fellow that,” said the inspector. “Something honest and\\n\\ningenuous about him.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI agreed. In the two years that Geoffrey Raymond has been secretary to\\n\\nAckroyd, I have never seen him ruffled or out of temper. And he has\\n\\nbeen, I know, a most efficient secretary.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a minute or two Raymond returned, accompanied by Blunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I was right,” said Raymond excitedly. “It _is_ the Tunisian dagger.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Major Blunt hasn’t looked at it yet,” objected the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Saw it the moment I came into the study,” said the quiet man.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You recognized it then?”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You said nothing about it,” said the inspector suspiciously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Wrong moment,” said Blunt. “Lot of harm done by blurting out things at\\n\\nthe wrong time.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe returned the inspector’s stare placidly enough.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latter grunted at last and turned away. He brought the dagger over\\n\\nto Blunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re quite sure about it, sir. You identify it positively?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Absolutely. No doubt whatever.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where was this—er—curio usually kept? Can you tell me that, sir?”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was the secretary who answered.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In the silver table in the drawing-room.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What?” I exclaimed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe others looked at me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, doctor?” said the inspector encouragingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s nothing.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, doctor?” said the inspector again, still more encouragingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s so trivial,” I explained apologetically. “Only that when I\\n\\narrived last night for dinner I heard the lid of the silver table being\\n\\nshut down in the drawing-room.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw profound skepticism and a trace of suspicion on the inspector’s\\n\\ncountenance.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How did you know it was the silver table lid?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was forced to explain in detail—a long, tedious explanation which I\\n\\nwould infinitely rather not have had to make.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector heard me to the end.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Was the dagger in its place when you were looking over the contents?”\\n\\nhe asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know,” I said. “I can’t say I remember noticing it—but, of\\n\\ncourse, it may have been there all the time.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’d better get hold of the housekeeper,” remarked the inspector, and\\n\\npulled the bell.\\n\\n\\n\\nA few minutes later Miss Russell, summoned by Parker, entered the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t think I went near the silver table,” she said, when the\\n\\ninspector had posed his question. “I was looking to see that all the\\n\\nflowers were fresh. Oh! yes, I remember now. The silver table was\\n\\nopen—which it had no business to be, and I shut the lid down as I\\n\\npassed.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe looked at him aggressively.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I see,” said the inspector. “Can you tell me if this dagger was in its\\n\\nplace then?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMiss Russell looked at the weapon composedly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can’t say, I’m sure,” she replied. “I didn’t stop to look. I knew\\n\\nthe family would be down any minute, and I wanted to get away.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Thank you,” said the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was just a trace of hesitation in his manner, as though he would\\n\\nhave liked to question her further, but Miss Russell clearly accepted\\n\\nthe words as a dismissal, and glided from the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Rather a Tartar, I should fancy, eh?” said the inspector, looking\\n\\nafter her. “Let me see. This silver table is in front of one of the\\n\\nwindows, I think you said, doctor?”\\n\\n\\n\\nRaymond answered for me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, the left-hand window.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And the window was open?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“They were both ajar.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, I don’t think we need go into the question much further.\\n\\nSomebody—I’ll just say somebody—could get that dagger any time he\\n\\nliked, and exactly when he got it doesn’t matter in the least. I’ll be\\n\\ncoming up in the morning with the chief constable, Mr. Raymond. Until\\n\\nthen, I’ll keep the key of that door. I want Colonel Melrose to see\\n\\neverything exactly as it is. I happen to know that he’s dining out the\\n\\nother side of the county, and, I believe, staying the night....”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe watched the inspector take up the jar.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I shall have to pack this carefully,” he observed. “It’s going to be\\n\\nan important piece of evidence in more ways than one.”\\n\\n\\n\\nA few minutes later as I came out of the billiard room with Raymond,\\n\\nthe latter gave a low chuckle of amusement.\\n\\n\\n\\nI felt the pressure of his hand on my arm, and followed the direction\\n\\nof his eyes. Inspector Davis seemed to be inviting Parker’s opinion of\\n\\na small pocket diary.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A little obvious,” murmured my companion. “So Parker is the suspect,\\n\\nis he? Shall we oblige Inspector Davis with a set of our fingerprints\\n\\nalso?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe took two cards from the card tray, wiped them with his silk\\n\\nhandkerchief, then handed one to me and took the other himself. Then,\\n\\nwith a grin, he handed them to the police inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Souvenirs,” he said. “No. 1, Dr. Sheppard; No. 2, my humble self. One\\n\\nfrom Major Blunt will be forthcoming in the morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\nYouth is very buoyant. Even the brutal murder of his friend and\\n\\nemployer could not dim Geoffrey Raymond’s spirits for long. Perhaps\\n\\nthat is as it should be. I do not know. I have lost the quality of\\n\\nresilience long since myself.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was very late when I got back, and I hoped that Caroline would have\\n\\ngone to bed. I might have known better.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe had hot cocoa waiting for me, and whilst I drank it, she extracted\\n\\nthe whole history of the evening from me. I said nothing of the\\n\\nblackmailing business, but contented myself with giving her the facts\\n\\nof the murder.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The police suspect Parker,” I said, as I rose to my feet and prepared\\n\\nto ascend to bed. “There seems a fairly clear case against him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Parker!” said my sister. “Fiddlesticks! That inspector must be a\\n\\nperfect fool. Parker indeed! Don’t tell me.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWith which obscure pronouncement we went up to bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\n\\n                   I LEARN MY NEIGHBOR’S PROFESSION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the following morning I hurried unforgivably over my round. My\\n\\nexcuse can be that I had no very serious cases to attend. On my return\\n\\nCaroline came into the hall to greet me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Flora Ackroyd is here,” she announced in an excited whisper.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI concealed my surprise as best I could.\\n\\n\\n\\n“She’s very anxious to see you. She’s been here half an hour.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline led the way into our small sitting-room, and I followed.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora was sitting on the sofa by the window. She was in black and she\\n\\nsat nervously twisting her hands together. I was shocked by the sight\\n\\nof her face. All the color had faded away from it. But when she spoke\\n\\nher manner was as composed and resolute as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dr. Sheppard, I have come to ask you to help me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course he’ll help you, my dear,” said Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t think Flora really wished Caroline to be present at the\\n\\ninterview. She would, I am sure, have infinitely preferred to speak to\\n\\nme privately. But she also wanted to waste no time, so she made the\\n\\nbest of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I want you to come to The Larches with me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The Larches?” I queried, surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\n“To see that funny little man?” exclaimed Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes. You know who he is, don’t you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“We fancied,” I said, “that he might be a retired hairdresser.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora’s blue eyes opened very wide.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why, he’s Hercule Poirot! You know who I mean—the private detective.\\n\\nThey say he’s done the most wonderful things—just like detectives do in\\n\\nbooks. A year ago he retired and came to live down here. Uncle knew who\\n\\nhe was, but he promised not to tell any one, because M. Poirot wanted\\n\\nto live quietly without being bothered by people.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“So that’s who he is,” I said slowly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’ve heard of him, of course?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m rather an old fogey, as Caroline tells me,” I said, “but I _have_\\n\\njust heard of him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Extraordinary!” commented Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t know what she was referring to—possibly her own failure to\\n\\ndiscover the truth.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You want to go and see him?” I asked slowly. “Now why?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“To get him to investigate this murder, of course,” said Caroline\\n\\nsharply. “Don’t be so stupid, James.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was not really being stupid. Caroline does not always understand what\\n\\nI am driving at.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You haven’t got confidence in Inspector Davis?” I went on.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course she hasn’t,” said Caroline. “I haven’t either.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAny one would have thought it was Caroline’s uncle who had been\\n\\nmurdered.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And how do you know he would take up the case?” I asked. “Remember he\\n\\nhas retired from active work.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s just it,” said Flora simply. “I’ve got to persuade him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are sure you are doing wisely?” I asked gravely.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course she is,” said Caroline. “I’ll go with her myself if she\\n\\nlikes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’d rather the doctor came with me if you don’t mind, Miss Sheppard,”\\n\\nsaid Flora.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe knows the value of being direct on certain occasions. Any hints\\n\\nwould certainly have been wasted on Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You see,” she explained, following directness with tact, “Dr. Sheppard\\n\\nbeing the doctor, and having found the body, he would be able to give\\n\\nall the details to M. Poirot.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” said Caroline grudgingly, “I see that.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI took a turn or two up and down the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Flora,” I said gravely, “be guided by me. I advise you not to drag\\n\\nthis detective into the case.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora sprang to her feet. The color rushed into her cheeks.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know why you say that,” she cried. “But it’s exactly for that reason\\n\\nI’m so anxious to go. You’re afraid! But I’m not. I know Ralph better\\n\\nthan you do.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ralph,” said Caroline. “What has Ralph got to do with it?”\\n\\n\\n\\nNeither of us heeded her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ralph may be weak,” continued Flora. “He may have done foolish things\\n\\nin the past—wicked things even—but he wouldn’t murder any one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, no,” I exclaimed. “I never thought it of him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then why did you go to the Three Boars last night?” demanded Flora,\\n\\n“on your way home—after uncle’s body was found?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was momentarily silenced. I had hoped that that visit of mine would\\n\\nremain unnoticed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How did you know about that?” I countered.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I went there this morning,” said Flora. “I heard from the servants\\n\\nthat Ralph was staying there——”\\n\\n\\n\\nI interrupted her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You had no idea that he was in King’s Abbot?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No. I was astounded. I couldn’t understand it. I went there and asked\\n\\nfor him. They told me, what I suppose they told you last night, that\\n\\nhe went out at about nine o’clock yesterday evening—and—and never came\\n\\nback.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHer eyes met mine defiantly, and as though answering something in my\\n\\nlook, she burst out:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, why shouldn’t he? He might have gone—anywhere. He may even have\\n\\ngone back to London.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Leaving his luggage behind?” I asked gently.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora stamped her foot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t care. There must be a simple explanation.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And that’s why you want to go to Hercule Poirot? Isn’t it better to\\n\\nleave things as they are? The police don’t suspect Ralph in the least,\\n\\nremember. They’re working on quite another tack.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But that’s just _it_,” cried the girl. “They _do_ suspect him. A man\\n\\nfrom Cranchester turned up this morning—Inspector Raglan, a horrid,\\n\\nweaselly little man. I found he had been to the Three Boars this\\n\\nmorning before me. They told me all about his having been there, and\\n\\nthe questions he had asked. He must think Ralph did it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s a change of mind from last night, if so,” I said slowly. “He\\n\\ndoesn’t believe in Davis’s theory that it was Parker then?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Parker indeed,” said my sister, and snorted.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora came forward and laid her hand on my arm.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! Dr. Sheppard, let us go at once to this M. Poirot. He will find\\n\\nout the truth.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear Flora,” I said gently, laying my hand on hers. “Are you quite\\n\\nsure it is the truth we want?”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe looked at me, nodding her head gravely.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re not sure,” she said. “I am. I know Ralph better than you do.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course he didn’t do it,” said Caroline, who had been keeping silent\\n\\nwith great difficulty. “Ralph may be extravagant, but he’s a dear boy,\\n\\nand has the nicest manners.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI wanted to tell Caroline that large numbers of murderers have had\\n\\nnice manners, but the presence of Flora restrained me. Since the\\n\\ngirl was determined, I was forced to give in to her and we started\\n\\nat once, getting away before my sister was able to fire off any more\\n\\npronouncements beginning with her favorite words, “Of course.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAn old woman with an immense Breton cap opened the door of The Larches\\n\\nto us. M. Poirot was at home, it seemed.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe were ushered into a little sitting-room arranged with formal\\n\\nprecision, and there, after the lapse of a minute or so, my friend of\\n\\nyesterday came to us.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Monsieur le docteur,” he said, smiling. “Mademoiselle.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe bowed to Flora.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps,” I began, “you have heard of the tragedy which occurred last\\n\\nnight.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHis face grew grave.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But certainly I have heard. It is horrible. I offer mademoiselle all\\n\\nmy sympathy. In what way can I serve you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Miss Ackroyd,” I said, “wants you to—to——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“To find the murderer,” said Flora in a clear voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I see,” said the little man. “But the police will do that, will they\\n\\nnot?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“They might make a mistake,” said Flora. “They are on their way to make\\n\\na mistake now, I think. Please, M. Poirot, won’t you help us? If—if it\\n\\nis a question of money——”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot held up his hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not that, I beg of you, mademoiselle. Not that I do not care for\\n\\nmoney.” His eyes showed a momentary twinkle. “Money, it means much to\\n\\nme and always has done. No, if I go into this, you must understand one\\n\\nthing clearly. _I shall go through with it to the end._ The good dog,\\n\\nhe does not leave the scent, remember! You may wish that, after all,\\n\\nyou had left it to the local police.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I want the truth,” said Flora, looking him straight in the eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n“All the truth?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“All the truth.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then I accept,” said the little man quietly. “And I hope you will not\\n\\nregret those words. Now, tell me all the circumstances.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dr. Sheppard had better tell you,” said Flora. “He knows more than I\\n\\ndo.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThus enjoined, I plunged into a careful narrative, embodying all the\\n\\nfacts I have previously set down. Poirot listened carefully, inserting\\n\\na question here and there, but for the most part sitting in silence,\\n\\nhis eyes on the ceiling.\\n\\n\\n\\nI brought my story to a close with the departure of the inspector and\\n\\nmyself from Fernly Park the previous night.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And now,” said Flora, as I finished, “tell him all about Ralph.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI hesitated, but her imperious glance drove me on.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You went to this inn—this Three Boars—last night on your way home?”\\n\\nasked Poirot, as I brought my tale to a close. “Now exactly why was\\n\\nthat?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI paused a moment to choose my words carefully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thought some one ought to inform the young man of his uncle’s death.\\n\\nIt occurred to me after I had left Fernly that possibly no one but\\n\\nmyself and Mr. Ackroyd were aware that he was staying in the village.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite so. That was your only motive in going there, eh?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That was my only motive,” I said stiffly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was not to—shall we say—reassure yourself about _ce jeune homme_?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Reassure myself?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think, M. le docteur, that you know very well what I mean, though\\n\\nyou pretend not to do so. I suggest that it would have been a relief\\n\\nto you if you had found that Captain Paton had been at home all the\\n\\nevening.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not at all,” I said sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe little detective shook his head at me gravely.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have not the trust in me of Miss Flora,” he said. “But no matter.\\n\\nWhat we have to look at is this—Captain Paton is missing, under\\n\\ncircumstances which call for an explanation. I will not hide from you\\n\\nthat the matter looks grave. Still, it may admit of a perfectly simple\\n\\nexplanation.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s just what I keep saying,” cried Flora eagerly.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot touched no more upon that theme. Instead he suggested an\\n\\nimmediate visit to the local police. He thought it better for Flora\\n\\nto return home, and for me to be the one to accompany him there and\\n\\nintroduce him to the officer in charge of the case.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe carried out this plan forthwith. We found Inspector Davis outside\\n\\nthe police station looking very glum indeed. With him was Colonel\\n\\nMelrose, the Chief Constable, and another man whom, from Flora’s\\n\\ndescription of “weaselly,” I had no difficulty in recognizing as\\n\\nInspector Raglan from Cranchester.\\n\\n\\n\\nI know Melrose fairly well, and I introduced Poirot to him and\\n\\nexplained the situation. The chief constable was clearly vexed, and\\n\\nInspector Raglan looked as black as thunder. Davis, however, seemed\\n\\nslightly exhilarated by the sight of his superior officer’s annoyance.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The case is going to be plain as a pikestaff,” said Raglan. “Not the\\n\\nleast need for amateurs to come butting in. You’d think any fool would\\n\\nhave seen the way things were last night, and then we shouldn’t have\\n\\nlost twelve hours.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe directed a vengeful glance at poor Davis, who received it with\\n\\nperfect stolidity.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Ackroyd’s family must, of course, do what they see fit,” said\\n\\nColonel Melrose. “But we cannot have the official investigation\\n\\nhampered in any way. I know M. Poirot’s great reputation, of course,”\\n\\nhe added courteously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The police can’t advertise themselves, worse luck,” said Raglan.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Poirot who saved the situation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is true that I have retired from the world,” he said. “I never\\n\\nintended to take up a case again. Above all things, I have a horror of\\n\\npublicity. I must beg, that in the case of my being able to contribute\\n\\nsomething to the solution of the mystery, my name may not be mentioned.”\\n\\n\\n\\nInspector Raglan’s face lightened a little.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve heard of some very remarkable successes of yours,” observed the\\n\\ncolonel, thawing.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have had much experience,” said Poirot quietly. “But most of my\\n\\nsuccesses have been obtained by the aid of the police. I admire\\n\\nenormously your English police. If Inspector Raglan permits me to\\n\\nassist him, I shall be both honored and flattered.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector’s countenance became still more gracious.\\n\\n\\n\\nColonel Melrose drew me aside.\\n\\n\\n\\n“From all I hear, this little fellow’s done some really remarkable\\n\\nthings,” he murmured. “We’re naturally anxious not to have to call in\\n\\nScotland Yard. Raglan seems very sure of himself, but I’m not quite\\n\\ncertain that I agree with him. You see, I—er—know the parties concerned\\n\\nbetter than he does. This fellow doesn’t seem out after kudos, does he?\\n\\nWould work in with us unobtrusively, eh?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“To the greater glory of Inspector Raglan,” I said solemnly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, well,” said Colonel Melrose breezily in a louder voice, “we must\\n\\nput you wise to the latest developments, M. Poirot.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thank you,” said Poirot. “My friend, Dr. Sheppard, said something of\\n\\nthe butler being suspected?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s all bunkum,” said Raglan instantly. “These high-class servants\\n\\nget in such a funk that they act suspiciously for nothing at all.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The fingerprints?” I hinted.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing like Parker’s.” He gave a faint smile, and added: “And yours\\n\\nand Mr. Raymond’s don’t fit either, doctor.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What about those of Captain Ralph Paton?” asked Poirot quietly.\\n\\n\\n\\nI felt a secret admiration for the way he took the bull by the horns. I\\n\\nsaw a look of respect creep into the inspector’s eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I see you don’t let the grass grow under your feet, Mr. Poirot. It\\n\\nwill be a pleasure to work with you, I’m sure. We’re going to take that\\n\\nyoung gentleman’s fingerprints as soon as we can lay hands upon him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can’t help thinking you’re mistaken, inspector,” said Colonel\\n\\nMelrose warmly. “I’ve known Ralph Paton from a boy upward. He’d never\\n\\nstoop to murder.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Maybe not,” said the inspector tonelessly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What have you got against him?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Went out just on nine o’clock last night. Was seen in neighborhood of\\n\\nFernly Park somewhere about nine-thirty. Not been seen since. Believed\\n\\nto be in serious money difficulties. I’ve got a pair of his shoes\\n\\nhere—shoes with rubber studs in them. He had two pairs, almost exactly\\n\\nalike. I’m going up now to compare them with those footmarks. The\\n\\nconstable is up there seeing that no one tampers with them.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’ll go at once,” said Colonel Melrose. “You and M. Poirot will\\n\\naccompany us, will you not?”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe assented, and all drove up in the colonel’s car. The inspector was\\n\\nanxious to get at once to the footmarks, and asked to be put down at\\n\\nthe lodge. About half-way up the drive, on the right, a path branched\\n\\noff which led round to the terrace and the window of Ackroyd’s study.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Would you like to go with the inspector, M. Poirot?” asked the chief\\n\\nconstable, “or would you prefer to examine the study?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot chose the latter alternative. Parker opened the door to us. His\\n\\nmanner was smug and deferential, and he seemed to have recovered from\\n\\nhis panic of the night before.\\n\\n\\n\\nColonel Melrose took a key from his pocket, and unlocking the door\\n\\nwhich led into the lobby, he ushered us through into the study.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Except for the removal of the body, M. Poirot, this room is exactly as\\n\\nit was last night.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And the body was found—where?”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs precisely as possible, I described Ackroyd’s position. The arm-chair\\n\\nstill stood in front of the fire.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot went and sat down in it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The blue letter you speak of, where was it when you left the room?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Ackroyd had laid it down on this little table at his right hand.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Except for that, everything was in its place?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I think so.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Colonel Melrose, would you be so extremely obliging as to sit down in\\n\\nthis chair a minute. I thank you. Now, M. le docteur, will you kindly\\n\\nindicate to me the exact position of the dagger?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI did so, whilst the little man stood in the doorway.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The hilt of the dagger was plainly visible from the door then. Both\\n\\nyou and Parker could see it at once?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot went next to the window.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The electric light was on, of course, when you discovered the body?”\\n\\nhe asked over his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n\\nI assented, and joined him where he was studying the marks on the\\n\\nwindow-sill.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The rubber studs are the same pattern as those in Captain Paton’s\\n\\nshoes,” he said quietly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he came back once more to the middle of the room. His eye traveled\\n\\nround, searching everything in the room with a quick, trained glance.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Are you a man of good observation, Dr. Sheppard?” he asked at last.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think so,” I said, surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There was a fire in the grate, I see. When you broke the door down and\\n\\nfound Mr. Ackroyd dead, how was the fire? Was it low?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI gave a vexed laugh.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I—I really can’t say. I didn’t notice. Perhaps Mr. Raymond or Major\\n\\nBlunt——”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe little man opposite me shook his head with a faint smile.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One must always proceed with method. I made an error of judgment in\\n\\nasking you that question. To each man his own knowledge. You could tell\\n\\nme the details of the patient’s appearance—nothing there would escape\\n\\nyou. If I wanted information about the papers on that desk, Mr. Raymond\\n\\nwould have noticed anything there was to see. To find out about the\\n\\nfire, I must ask the man whose business it is to observe such things.\\n\\nYou permit——”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe moved swiftly to the fireplace and rang the bell.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter a lapse of a minute or two Parker appeared.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The bell rang, sir,” he said hesitatingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come in, Parker,” said Colonel Melrose. “This gentleman wants to ask\\n\\nyou something.”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker transferred a respectful attention to Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Parker,” said the little man, “when you broke down the door with Dr.\\n\\nSheppard last night, and found your master dead, what was the state of\\n\\nthe fire?”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker replied without a pause.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It had burned very low, sir. It was almost out.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” said Poirot. The exclamation sounded almost triumphant. He went\\n\\non:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Look round you, my good Parker. Is this room exactly as it was then?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe butler’s eye swept round. It came to rest on the windows.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The curtains were drawn, sir, and the electric light was on.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded approval.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Anything else?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir, this chair was drawn out a little more.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe indicated a big grandfather chair to the left of the door between it\\n\\nand the window. I append a plan of the room with the chair in question\\n\\nmarked with an X.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just show me,” said Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n\\n\\n  +----------------      +-----------------+\\n\\n  |    +           DOOR /  GRANDFATHER     |\\n\\n  |   / \\\\              /   CHAIR   +---+   |\\n\\n  |  /   +                          ]  |   |\\n\\n  | +   / SMALL                  X  ]  |   |\\n\\n  |  \\\\ /  TABLE                    +---+   |\\n\\n  |   +                                    |\\n\\n  +++                                      |\\n\\n  |||  +---+ CHAIR IN WHICH          ___   |\\n\\n  |||   ]  | ACKROYD WAS            /   \\\\  |\\n\\n  |||  +---+ FOUND           TABLE |     | |\\n\\n  |||                               \\\\___/  |\\n\\n  |||                                      |\\n\\n  |||                                      |\\n\\n  +++  +---+                           +   |\\n\\n  | ^   ]  | CHAIR IN WHICH           / \\\\  |\\n\\n  | |  +---+ SHEPPARD SAT          / /   + |\\n\\n  | |                               /   /  |\\n\\n  | |                       DESK & +   /   |\\n\\n  | |   FIREPLACE           CHAIR   \\\\ /    |\\n\\n  | +------------                    +     |\\n\\n  +----------------------------------------+\\n\\n]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe butler drew the chair in question out a good two feet from the\\n\\nwall, turning it so that the seat faced the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Voilà ce qui est curieux_,” murmured Poirot. “No one would want to\\n\\nsit in a chair in such a position, I fancy. Now who pushed it back into\\n\\nplace again, I wonder? Did you, my friend?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, sir,” said Parker. “I was too upset with seeing the master and\\n\\nall.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot looked across at me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did you, doctor?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was back in position when I arrived with the police, sir,” put in\\n\\nParker. “I’m sure of that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Curious,” said Poirot again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Raymond or Blunt must have pushed it back,” I suggested. “Surely it\\n\\nisn’t important?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is completely unimportant,” said Poirot. “That is why it is so\\n\\ninteresting,” he added softly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Excuse me a minute,” said Colonel Melrose. He left the room with\\n\\nParker.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you think Parker is speaking the truth?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“About the chair, yes. Otherwise I do not know. You will find, M. le\\n\\ndocteur, if you have much to do with cases of this kind, that they all\\n\\nresemble each other in one thing.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is that?” I asked curiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Every one concerned in them has something to hide.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Have I?” I asked, smiling.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot looked at me attentively.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think you have,” he said quietly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Have you told me everything known to you about this young man Paton?”\\n\\nHe smiled as I grew red. “Oh! do not fear. I will not press you. I\\n\\nshall learn it in good time.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wish you’d tell me something of your methods,” I said hastily, to\\n\\ncover my confusion. “The point about the fire, for instance?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! that was very simple. You leave Mr. Ackroyd at—ten minutes to\\n\\nnine, was it not?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, exactly, I should say.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The window is then closed and bolted and the door unlocked. At a\\n\\nquarter past ten when the body is discovered, the door is locked and\\n\\nthe window is open. Who opened it? Clearly only Mr. Ackroyd himself\\n\\ncould have done so, and for one of two reasons. Either because the room\\n\\nbecame unbearably hot (but since the fire was nearly out and there was\\n\\na sharp drop in temperature last night, that cannot be the reason),\\n\\nor because he admitted some one that way. And if he admitted some one\\n\\nthat way, it must have been some one well known to him, since he had\\n\\npreviously shown himself uneasy on the subject of that same window.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It sounds very simple,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Everything is simple, if you arrange the facts methodically. We are\\n\\nconcerned now with the personality of the person who was with him at\\n\\nnine-thirty last night. Everything goes to show that that was the\\n\\nindividual admitted by the window, and though Mr. Ackroyd was seen\\n\\nalive later by Miss Flora, we cannot approach a solution of the mystery\\n\\nuntil we know who that visitor was. The window may have been left open\\n\\nafter his departure and so afforded entrance to the murderer, or the\\n\\nsame person may have returned a second time. Ah! here is the colonel\\n\\nwho returns.”\\n\\n\\n\\nColonel Melrose entered with an animated manner.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That telephone call has been traced at last,” he said. “It did not\\n\\ncome from here. It was put through to Dr. Sheppard at 10.15 last night\\n\\nfrom a public call office at King’s Abbot station. And at 10.23 the\\n\\nnight mail leaves for Liverpool.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\n\\n                     INSPECTOR RAGLAN IS CONFIDENT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe looked at each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’ll have inquiries made at the station, of course?” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Naturally, but I’m not over sanguine as to the result. You know what\\n\\nthat station is like.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI did. King’s Abbot is a mere village, but its station happens to\\n\\nbe an important junction. Most of the big expresses stop there, and\\n\\ntrains are shunted, re-sorted, and made up. It has two or three public\\n\\ntelephone boxes. At that time of night three local trains come in\\n\\nclose upon each other, to catch the connection with the express for\\n\\nthe north which comes in at 10.19 and leaves at 10.23. The whole place\\n\\nis in a bustle, and the chances of one particular person being noticed\\n\\ntelephoning or getting into the express are very small indeed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But why telephone at all?” demanded Melrose. “That is what I find so\\n\\nextraordinary. There seems no rhyme or reason in the thing.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot carefully straightened a china ornament on one of the bookcases.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Be sure there was a reason,” he said over his shoulder.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But what reason could it be?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“When we know that, we shall know everything. This case is very curious\\n\\nand very interesting.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was something almost indescribable in the way he said those last\\n\\nwords. I felt that he was looking at the case from some peculiar angle\\n\\nof his own, and what he saw I could not tell.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe went to the window and stood there, looking out.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You say it was nine o’clock, Dr. Sheppard, when you met this stranger\\n\\noutside the gate?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe asked the question without turning round.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I replied. “I heard the church clock chime the hour.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How long would it take him to reach the house—to reach this window,\\n\\nfor instance?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Five minutes at the outside. Two or three minutes only if he took the\\n\\npath at the right of the drive and came straight here.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But to do that he would have to know the way. How can I explain\\n\\nmyself?—it would mean that he had been here before—that he knew his\\n\\nsurroundings.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is true,” replied Colonel Melrose.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We could find out, doubtless, if Mr. Ackroyd had received any\\n\\nstrangers during the past week?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Young Raymond could tell us that,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Or Parker,” suggested Colonel Melrose.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Ou tous les deux_,” suggested Poirot, smiling.\\n\\n\\n\\nColonel Melrose went in search of Raymond, and I rang the bell once\\n\\nmore for Parker.\\n\\n\\n\\nColonel Melrose returned almost immediately, accompanied by the young\\n\\nsecretary, whom he introduced to Poirot. Geoffrey Raymond was fresh and\\n\\ndebonair as ever. He seemed surprised and delighted to make Poirot’s\\n\\nacquaintance.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No idea you’d been living among us incognito, M. Poirot,” he said. “It\\n\\nwill be a great privilege to watch you at work——Hallo, what’s this?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot had been standing just to the left of the door. Now he moved\\n\\naside suddenly, and I saw that while my back was turned he must have\\n\\nswiftly drawn out the arm-chair till it stood in the position Parker\\n\\nhad indicated.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Want me to sit in the chair whilst you take a blood test?” asked\\n\\nRaymond good-humoredly. “What’s the idea?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“M. Raymond, this chair was pulled out—so—last night when Mr. Ackroyd\\n\\nwas found killed. Some one moved it back again into place. Did you do\\n\\nso?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe secretary’s reply came without a second’s hesitation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, indeed I didn’t. I don’t even remember that it was in that\\n\\nposition, but it must have been if you say so. Anyway, somebody else\\n\\nmust have moved it back to its proper place. Have they destroyed a clew\\n\\nin doing so? Too bad!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is of no consequence,” said the detective. “Of no consequence\\n\\nwhatever. What I really want to ask you is this, M. Raymond: Did any\\n\\nstranger come to see Mr. Ackroyd during this past week?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe secretary reflected for a minute or two, knitting his brows, and\\n\\nduring the pause Parker appeared in answer to the bell.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” said Raymond at last. “I can’t remember any one. Can you, Parker?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, sir?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Any stranger coming to see Mr. Ackroyd this week?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe butler reflected for a minute or two.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There was the young man who came on Wednesday, sir,” he said at last.\\n\\n“From Curtis and Troute, I understood he was.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRaymond moved this aside with an impatient hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! yes, I remember, but that is not the kind of stranger this\\n\\ngentleman means.” He turned to Poirot. “Mr. Ackroyd had some idea of\\n\\npurchasing a dictaphone,” he explained. “It would have enabled us to\\n\\nget through a lot more work in a limited time. The firm in question\\n\\nsent down their representative, but nothing came of it. Mr. Ackroyd did\\n\\nnot make up his mind to purchase.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot turned to the butler.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Can you describe this young man to me, my good Parker?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He was fair-haired, sir, and short. Very neatly dressed in a blue\\n\\nserge suit. A very presentable young man, sir, for his station in life.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot turned to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The man you met outside the gate, doctor, was tall, was he not?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I said. “Somewhere about six feet, I should say.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“There is nothing in that, then,” declared the Belgian. “I thank you,\\n\\nParker.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe butler spoke to Raymond.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Hammond has just arrived, sir,” he said. “He is anxious to know if\\n\\nhe can be of any service, and he would be glad to have a word with you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll come at once,” said the young man. He hurried out. Poirot looked\\n\\ninquiringly at the chief constable.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The family solicitor, M. Poirot,” said the latter.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is a busy time for this young M. Raymond,” murmured M. Poirot. “He\\n\\nhas the air efficient, that one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I believe Mr. Ackroyd considered him a most able secretary.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He has been here—how long?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just on two years, I fancy.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“His duties he fulfills punctiliously. Of that I am sure. In what\\n\\nmanner does he amuse himself? Does he go in for _le sport_?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Private secretaries haven’t much time for that sort of thing,” said\\n\\nColonel Melrose, smiling. “Raymond plays golf, I believe. And tennis in\\n\\nthe summer time.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He does not attend the courses—I should say the running of the horses?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Race meetings? No, I don’t think he’s interested in racing.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded and seemed to lose interest. He glanced slowly round the\\n\\nstudy.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have seen, I think, all that there is to be seen here.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI, too, looked round.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If those walls could speak,” I murmured.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A tongue is not enough,” he said. “They would have to have also eyes\\n\\nand ears. But do not be too sure that these dead things”—he touched\\n\\nthe top of the bookcase as he spoke—“are always dumb. To me they speak\\n\\nsometimes—chairs, tables—they have their message!”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe turned away towards the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What message?” I cried. “What have they said to you to-day?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked over his shoulder and raised one eyebrow quizzically.\\n\\n\\n\\n“An opened window,” he said. “A locked door. A chair that apparently\\n\\nmoved itself. To all three I say, ‘Why?’ and I find no answer.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe shook his head, puffed out his chest, and stood blinking at us. He\\n\\nlooked ridiculously full of his own importance. It crossed my mind\\n\\nto wonder whether he was really any good as a detective. Had his big\\n\\nreputation been built up on a series of lucky chances?\\n\\n\\n\\nI think the same thought must have occurred to Colonel Melrose, for he\\n\\nfrowned.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Anything more you want to see, M. Poirot?” he inquired brusquely.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You would perhaps be so kind as to show me the silver table from which\\n\\nthe weapon was taken? After that, I will trespass on your kindness no\\n\\nlonger.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe went to the drawing-room, but on the way the constable waylaid the\\n\\ncolonel, and after a muttered conversation the latter excused himself\\n\\nand left us together. I showed Poirot the silver table, and after\\n\\nraising the lid once or twice and letting it fall, he pushed open the\\n\\nwindow and stepped out on the terrace. I followed him.\\n\\n\\n\\nInspector Raglan had just turned the corner of the house, and was\\n\\ncoming towards us. His face looked grim and satisfied.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So there you are, M. Poirot,” he said. “Well, this isn’t going to be\\n\\nmuch of a case. I’m sorry, too. A nice enough young fellow gone wrong.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot’s face fell, and he spoke very mildly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m afraid I shall not be able to be of much aid to you, then?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Next time, perhaps,” said the inspector soothingly. “Though we don’t\\n\\nhave murders every day in this quiet little corner of the world.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot’s gaze took on an admiring quality.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have been of a marvelous promptness,” he observed. “How exactly\\n\\ndid you go to work, if I may ask?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly,” said the inspector. “To begin with—method. That’s what I\\n\\nalways say—method!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” cried the other. “That, too, is my watchword. Method, order, and\\n\\nthe little gray cells.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The cells?” said the inspector, staring.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The little gray cells of the brain,” explained the Belgian.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, of course; well, we all use them, I suppose.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“In a greater or lesser degree,” murmured Poirot. “And there are, too,\\n\\ndifferences in quality. Then there is the psychology of a crime. One\\n\\nmust study that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” said the inspector, “you’ve been bitten with all this\\n\\npsychoanalysis stuff? Now, I’m a plain man——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. Raglan would not agree, I am sure, to that,” said Poirot, making\\n\\nhim a little bow.\\n\\n\\n\\nInspector Raglan, a little taken aback, bowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don’t understand,” he said, grinning broadly. “Lord, what a lot of\\n\\ndifference language makes. I’m telling you how I set to work. First of\\n\\nall, method. Mr. Ackroyd was last seen alive at a quarter to ten by his\\n\\nniece, Miss Flora Ackroyd. That’s fact number one, isn’t it?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you say so.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, it is. At half-past ten, the doctor here says that Mr. Ackroyd\\n\\nhas been dead at least half an hour. You stick to that, doctor?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly,” I said. “Half an hour or longer.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very good. That gives us exactly a quarter of an hour in which the\\n\\ncrime must have been committed. I make a list of every one in the\\n\\nhouse, and work through it, setting down opposite their names where\\n\\nthey were and what they were doing between the hour of 9.45 and 10 p.m.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe handed a sheet of paper to Poirot. I read it over his shoulder. It\\n\\nran as follows, written in a neat script:—\\n\\n\\n\\n  _Major Blunt.—In billiard room with Mr. Raymond. (Latter confirms.)_\\n\\n\\n\\n  _Mr. Raymond.—Billiard room. (See above.)_\\n\\n\\n\\n  _Mrs. Ackroyd.—9.45 watching billiard match. Went up to bed 9.55.\\n\\n      (Raymond and Blunt watched her up staircase.)_\\n\\n\\n\\n  _Miss Ackroyd.—Went straight from her uncle’s room upstairs.\\n\\n      (Confirmed by Parker, also housemaid, Elsie Dale.)_\\n\\n\\n\\n  _Servants_:—\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Parker.—Went straight to butler’s pantry. (Confirmed by\\n\\n      housekeeper, Miss Russell, who came down to speak to him about\\n\\n      something at 9.47, and remained at least ten minutes.)_\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Miss Russell.—As above. Spoke to housemaid, Elsie Dale, upstairs\\n\\n      at 9.45._\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Ursula Bourne (parlormaid).—In her own room until 9.55. Then in\\n\\n      Servants’ Hall._\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Mrs. Cooper (cook).—In Servants’ Hall._\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Gladys Jones (second housemaid).—In Servants’ Hall._\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Elsie Dale.—Upstairs in bedroom. Seen there by Miss Russell and\\n\\n      Miss Flora Ackroyd._\\n\\n\\n\\n    _Mary Thripp (kitchenmaid).—Servants’ Hall._\\n\\n\\n\\n“The cook has been here seven years, the parlormaid eighteen months,\\n\\nand Parker just over a year. The others are new. Except for something\\n\\nfishy about Parker, they all seem quite all right.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A very complete list,” said Poirot, handing it back to him. “I am\\n\\nquite sure that Parker did not do the murder,” he added gravely.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So is my sister,” I struck in. “And she’s usually right.” Nobody paid\\n\\nany attention to my interpolation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That disposes pretty effectually of the household,” continued the\\n\\ninspector. “Now we come to a very grave point. The woman at the\\n\\nlodge—Mary Black—was pulling the curtains last night when she saw\\n\\nRalph Paton turn in at the gate and go up towards the house.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She is sure of that?” I asked sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite sure. She knows him well by sight. He went past very quickly\\n\\nand turned off by the path to the right, which is a short cut to the\\n\\nterrace.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And what time was that?” asked Poirot, who had sat with an immovable\\n\\nface.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Exactly twenty-five minutes past nine,” said the inspector gravely.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a silence. Then the inspector spoke again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s all clear enough. It fits in without a flaw. At twenty-five\\n\\nminutes past nine, Captain Paton is seen passing the lodge; at\\n\\nnine-thirty or thereabouts, Mr. Geoffrey Raymond hears some one in here\\n\\nasking for money and Mr. Ackroyd refusing. What happens next? Captain\\n\\nPaton leaves the same way—through the window. He walks along the\\n\\nterrace, angry and baffled. He comes to the open drawing-room window.\\n\\nSay it’s now a quarter to ten. Miss Flora Ackroyd is saying good-night\\n\\nto her uncle. Major Blunt, Mr. Raymond, and Mrs. Ackroyd are in the\\n\\nbilliard room. The drawing-room is empty. He steals in, takes the\\n\\ndagger from the silver table, and returns to the study window. He slips\\n\\noff his shoes, climbs in, and—well, I don’t need to go into details.\\n\\nThen he slips out again and goes off. Hadn’t the nerve to go back to\\n\\nthe inn. He makes for the station, rings up from there——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why?” said Poirot softly.\\n\\n\\n\\nI jumped at the interruption. The little man was leaning forward. His\\n\\neyes shone with a queer green light.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment Inspector Raglan was taken aback by the question.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s difficult to say exactly why he did that,” he said at last. “But\\n\\nmurderers do funny things. You’d know that if you were in the police\\n\\nforce. The cleverest of them make stupid mistakes sometimes. But come\\n\\nalong and I’ll show you those footprints.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe followed him round the corner of the terrace to the study window. At\\n\\na word from Raglan a police constable produced the shoes which had been\\n\\nobtained from the local inn.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector laid them over the marks.\\n\\n\\n\\n“They’re the same,” he said confidently. “That is to say, they’re not\\n\\nthe same pair that actually made these prints. He went away in those.\\n\\nThis is a pair just like them, but older—see how the studs are worn\\n\\ndown.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Surely a great many people wear shoes with rubber studs in them?”\\n\\nasked Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s so, of course,” said the inspector. “I shouldn’t put so much\\n\\nstress on the footmarks if it wasn’t for everything else.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A very foolish young man, Captain Ralph Paton,” said Poirot\\n\\nthoughtfully. “To leave so much evidence of his presence.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! well,” said the inspector, “it was a dry, fine night, you know. He\\n\\nleft no prints on the terrace or on the graveled path. But, unluckily\\n\\nfor him, a spring must have welled up just lately at the end of the\\n\\npath from the drive. See here.”\\n\\n\\n\\nA small graveled path joined the terrace a few feet away. In one\\n\\nspot, a few yards from its termination, the ground was wet and boggy.\\n\\nCrossing this wet place there were again the marks of footsteps, and\\n\\namongst them the shoes with rubber studs.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot followed the path on a little way, the inspector by his side.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You noticed the women’s footprints?” he said suddenly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector laughed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Naturally. But several different women have walked this way—and men\\n\\nas well. It’s a regular short cut to the house, you see. It would be\\n\\nimpossible to sort out all the footsteps. After all, it’s the ones on\\n\\nthe window-sill that are really important.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s no good going farther,” said the inspector, as we came in view of\\n\\nthe drive. “It’s all graveled again here, and hard as it can be.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain Poirot nodded, but his eyes were fixed on a small garden house—a\\n\\nkind of superior summer-house. It was a little to the left of the path\\n\\nahead of us, and a graveled walk ran up to it.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot lingered about until the inspector had gone back towards the\\n\\nhouse. Then he looked at me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You must have indeed been sent from the good God to replace my\\n\\nfriend Hastings,” he said, with a twinkle. “I observe that you do not\\n\\nquit my side. How say you, Dr. Sheppard, shall we investigate that\\n\\nsummer-house? It interests me.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe went up to the door and opened it. Inside, the place was almost\\n\\ndark. There were one or two rustic seats, a croquet set, and some\\n\\nfolded deck-chairs.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was startled to observe my new friend. He had dropped to his hands\\n\\nand knees and was crawling about the floor. Every now and then he shook\\n\\nhis head as though not satisfied. Finally, he sat back on his heels.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing,” he murmured. “Well, perhaps it was not to be expected. But\\n\\nit would have meant so much——”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe broke off, stiffening all over. Then he stretched out his hand to\\n\\none of the rustic chairs. He detached something from one side of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is it?” I cried. “What have you found?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe smiled, unclosing his hand so that I should see what lay in the palm\\n\\nof it. A scrap of stiff white cambric.\\n\\n\\n\\nI took it from him, looked at it curiously, and then handed it back.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What do you make of it, eh, my friend?” he asked, eyeing me keenly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A scrap torn from a handkerchief,” I suggested, shrugging my shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe made another dart and picked up a small quill—a goose quill by the\\n\\nlook of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And that?” he cried triumphantly. “What do you make of that?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI only stared.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe slipped the quill into his pocket, and looked again at the scrap of\\n\\nwhite stuff.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A fragment of a handkerchief?” he mused. “Perhaps you are right. But\\n\\nremember this—_a good laundry does not starch a handkerchief_.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe nodded at me triumphantly, then he put away the scrap carefully in\\n\\nhis pocket-book.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\n\\n                           THE GOLDFISH POND\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe walked back to the house together. There was no sign of the\\n\\ninspector. Poirot paused on the terrace and stood with his back to the\\n\\nhouse, slowly turning his head from side to side.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Une belle propriété_,” he said at last appreciatively. “Who inherits\\n\\nit?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHis words gave me almost a shock. It is an odd thing, but until that\\n\\nmoment the question of inheritance had never come into my head. Poirot\\n\\nwatched me keenly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is a new idea to you, that,” he said at last. “You had not thought\\n\\nof it before—eh?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” I said truthfully. “I wish I had.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked at me again curiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wonder just what you mean by that,” he said thoughtfully. “Ah! no,”\\n\\nas I was about to speak. “_Inutile!_ You would not tell me your real\\n\\nthought.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Every one has something to hide,” I quoted, smiling.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Exactly.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You still believe that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“More than ever, my friend. But it is not easy to hide things from\\n\\nHercule Poirot. He has a knack of finding out.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe descended the steps of the Dutch garden as he spoke.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Let us walk a little,” he said over his shoulder. “The air is pleasant\\n\\nto-day.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI followed him. He led me down a path to the left enclosed in yew\\n\\nhedges. A walk led down the middle, bordered each side with formal\\n\\nflower beds, and at the end was a round paved recess with a seat and\\n\\na pond of goldfish. Instead of pursuing the path to the end, Poirot\\n\\ntook another which wound up the side of a wooded slope. In one spot the\\n\\ntrees had been cleared away, and a seat had been put. Sitting there one\\n\\nhad a splendid view over the countryside, and one looked right down on\\n\\nthe paved recess and the goldfish pond.\\n\\n\\n\\n“England is very beautiful,” said Poirot, his eyes straying over the\\n\\nprospect. Then he smiled. “And so are English girls,” he said in a\\n\\nlower tone. “Hush, my friend, and look at the pretty picture below us.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was then that I saw Flora. She was moving along the path we had\\n\\njust left and she was humming a little snatch of song. Her step was\\n\\nmore dancing than walking, and in spite of her black dress, there was\\n\\nnothing but joy in her whole attitude. She gave a sudden pirouette on\\n\\nher toes, and her black draperies swung out. At the same time she flung\\n\\nher head back and laughed outright.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs she did so a man stepped out from the trees. It was Hector Blunt.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe girl started. Her expression changed a little.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How you startled me—I didn’t see you.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt said nothing, but stood looking at her for a minute or two in\\n\\nsilence.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What I like about you,” said Flora, with a touch of malice, “is your\\n\\ncheery conversation.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI fancy that at that Blunt reddened under his tan. His voice, when he\\n\\nspoke, sounded different—it had a curious sort of humility in it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Never was much of a fellow for talking. Not even when I was young.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That was a very long time ago, I suppose,” said Flora gravely.\\n\\n\\n\\nI caught the undercurrent of laughter in her voice, but I don’t think\\n\\nBlunt did.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” he said simply, “it was.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How does it feel to be Methuselah?” asked Flora.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis time the laughter was more apparent, but Blunt was following out\\n\\nan idea of his own.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Remember the Johnny who sold his soul to the devil? In return for\\n\\nbeing made young again? There’s an opera about it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Faust, you mean?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s the beggar. Rum story. Some of us would do it if we could.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Any one would think you were creaking at the joints to hear you talk,”\\n\\ncried Flora, half vexed, half amused.\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt said nothing for a minute or two. Then he looked away from Flora\\n\\ninto the middle distance and observed to an adjacent tree trunk that it\\n\\nwas about time he got back to Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Are you going on another expedition—shooting things?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Expect so. Usually do, you know—shoot things, I mean.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You shot that head in the hall, didn’t you?”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt nodded. Then he jerked out, going rather red, as he did so:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Care for some decent skins any time? If so, I could get ’em for you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! please do,” cried Flora. “Will you really? You won’t forget?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I shan’t forget,” said Hector Blunt.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe added, in a sudden burst of communicativeness:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Time I went. I’m no good in this sort of life. Haven’t got the manners\\n\\nfor it. I’m a rough fellow, no use in society. Never remember the\\n\\nthings one’s expected to say. Yes, time I went.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But you’re not going at once,” cried Flora. “Not—not while we’re in\\n\\nall this trouble. Oh! please. If you go——”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe turned away a little.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You want me to stay?” asked Blunt.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe spoke deliberately but quite simply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We all——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I meant you personally,” said Blunt, with directness.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora turned slowly back again and met his eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I want you to stay,” she said, “if—if that makes any difference.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It makes all the difference,” said Blunt.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a moment’s silence. They sat down on the stone seat by the\\n\\ngoldfish pond. It seemed as though neither of them knew quite what to\\n\\nsay next.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It—it’s such a lovely morning,” said Flora at last. “You know, I can’t\\n\\nhelp feeling happy, in spite—in spite of everything. That’s awful, I\\n\\nsuppose?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite natural,” said Blunt. “Never saw your uncle until two years ago,\\n\\ndid you? Can’t be expected to grieve very much. Much better to have no\\n\\nhumbug about it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s something awfully consoling about you,” said Flora. “You make\\n\\nthings so simple.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Things are simple as a rule,” said the big game hunter.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not always,” said Flora.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer voice had lowered itself, and I saw Blunt turn and look at her,\\n\\nbringing his eyes back from (apparently) the coast of Africa to do so.\\n\\nHe evidently put his own construction on her change of tone, for he\\n\\nsaid, after a minute or two, in rather an abrupt manner:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“I say, you know, you mustn’t worry. About that young chap, I mean.\\n\\nInspector’s an ass. Everybody knows—utterly absurd to think he could\\n\\nhave done it. Man from outside. Burglar chap. That’s the only possible\\n\\nsolution.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora turned to look at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You really think so?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t you?” said Blunt quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I—oh, yes, of course.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother silence, and then Flora burst out:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m—I’ll tell you why I felt so happy this morning. However heartless\\n\\nyou think me, I’d rather tell you. It’s because the lawyer has been—Mr.\\n\\nHammond. He told us about the will. Uncle Roger has left me twenty\\n\\nthousand pounds. Think of it—twenty thousand beautiful pounds.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt looked surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Does it mean so much to you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mean much to me? Why, it’s everything. Freedom—life—no more scheming\\n\\nand scraping and lying——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Lying?” said Blunt, sharply interrupting.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora seemed taken aback for a minute.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You know what I mean,” she said uncertainly. “Pretending to be\\n\\nthankful for all the nasty castoff things rich relations give you. Last\\n\\nyear’s coats and skirts and hats.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t know much about ladies’ clothes; should have said you were\\n\\nalways very well turned out.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s cost me something, though,” said Flora in a low voice. “Don’t\\n\\nlet’s talk of horrid things. I’m so happy. I’m free. Free to do what I\\n\\nlike. Free not to——”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe stopped suddenly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not to what?” asked Blunt quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I forget now. Nothing important.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt had a stick in his hand, and he thrust it into the pond, poking\\n\\nat something.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What are you doing, Major Blunt?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s something bright down there. Wondered what it was—looks like a\\n\\ngold brooch. Now I’ve stirred up the mud and it’s gone.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps it’s a crown,” suggested Flora. “Like the one Mélisande saw in\\n\\nthe water.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mélisande,” said Blunt reflectively—“she’s in an opera, isn’t she?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, you seem to know a lot about operas.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“People take me sometimes,” said Blunt sadly. “Funny idea of\\n\\npleasure—worse racket than the natives make with their tom-toms.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora laughed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I remember Mélisande,” continued Blunt, “married an old chap old\\n\\nenough to be her father.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe threw a small piece of flint into the goldfish pond. Then, with a\\n\\nchange of manner, he turned to Flora.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Miss Ackroyd, can I do anything? About Paton, I mean. I know how\\n\\ndreadfully anxious you must be.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Flora in a cold voice. “There is really nothing to\\n\\nbe done. Ralph will be all right. I’ve got hold of the most wonderful\\n\\ndetective in the world, and he’s going to find out all about it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFor some time I had felt uneasy as to our position. We were not exactly\\n\\neavesdropping, since the two in the garden below had only to lift their\\n\\nheads to see us. Nevertheless, I should have drawn attention to our\\n\\npresence before now, had not my companion put a warning pressure on my\\n\\narm. Clearly he wished me to remain silent.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut now he rose briskly to his feet, clearing his throat.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I demand pardon,” he cried. “I cannot allow mademoiselle thus\\n\\nextravagantly to compliment me, and not draw attention to my presence.\\n\\nThey say the listener hears no good of himself, but that is not the\\n\\ncase this time. To spare my blushes, I must join you and apologize.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe hurried down the path with me close behind him, and joined the\\n\\nothers by the pond.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This is M. Hercule Poirot,” said Flora. “I expect you’ve heard of him.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot bowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know Major Blunt by reputation,” he said politely. “I am glad to\\n\\nhave encountered you, monsieur. I am in need of some information that\\n\\nyou can give me.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt looked at him inquiringly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When did you last see M. Ackroyd alive?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“At dinner.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And you neither saw nor heard anything of him after that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Didn’t see him. Heard his voice.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How was that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I strolled out on the terrace——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pardon me, what time was this?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“About half-past nine. I was walking up and down smoking in front of\\n\\nthe drawing-room window. I heard Ackroyd talking in his study——”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot stooped and removed a microscopic weed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Surely you couldn’t hear voices in the study from that part of the\\n\\nterrace,” he murmured.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was not looking at Blunt, but I was, and to my intense surprise, I\\n\\nsaw the latter flush.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Went as far as the corner,” he explained unwillingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! indeed?” said Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the mildest manner he conveyed an impression that more was wanted.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Thought I saw—a woman disappearing into the bushes. Just a gleam of\\n\\nwhite, you know. Must have been mistaken. It was while I was standing\\n\\nat the corner of the terrace that I heard Ackroyd’s voice speaking to\\n\\nthat secretary of his.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Speaking to Mr. Geoffrey Raymond?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes—that’s what I supposed at the time. Seems I was wrong.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Ackroyd didn’t address him by name?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then, if I may ask, why did you think——?”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt explained laboriously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Took it for granted that it _would_ be Raymond, because he had said\\n\\njust before I came out that he was taking some papers to Ackroyd. Never\\n\\nthought of it being anybody else.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Can you remember what the words you heard were?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Afraid I can’t. Something quite ordinary and unimportant. Only caught\\n\\na scrap of it. I was thinking of something else at the time.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is of no importance,” murmured Poirot. “Did you move a chair back\\n\\nagainst the wall when you went into the study after the body was\\n\\ndiscovered?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Chair? No—why should I?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders but did not answer. He turned to Flora.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There is one thing I should like to know from you, mademoiselle. When\\n\\nyou were examining the things in the silver table with Dr. Sheppard,\\n\\nwas the dagger in its place, or was it not?”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora’s chin shot up.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Inspector Raglan has been asking me that,” she said resentfully. “I’ve\\n\\ntold him, and I’ll tell you. I’m perfectly certain the dagger was _not_\\n\\nthere. He thinks it was and that Ralph sneaked it later in the evening.\\n\\nAnd—and he doesn’t believe me. He thinks I’m saying it to—to shield\\n\\nRalph.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And aren’t you?” I asked gravely.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora stamped her foot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You, too, Dr. Sheppard! Oh! it’s too bad.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot tactfully made a diversion.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is true what I heard you say, Major Blunt. There is something that\\n\\nglitters in this pond. Let us see if I can reach it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe knelt down by the pond, baring his arm to the elbow, and lowered it\\n\\nin very slowly, so as not to disturb the bottom of the pond. But in\\n\\nspite of all his precautions the mud eddied and swirled, and he was\\n\\nforced to draw his arm out again empty-handed.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe gazed ruefully at the mud upon his arm. I offered him my\\n\\nhandkerchief, which he accepted with fervent protestations of thanks.\\n\\nBlunt looked at his watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nearly lunch time,” he said. “We’d better be getting back to the\\n\\nhouse.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You will lunch with us, M. Poirot?” asked Flora. “I should like you to\\n\\nmeet my mother. She is—very fond of Ralph.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe little man bowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I shall be delighted, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And you will stay, too, won’t you, Dr. Sheppard?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI hesitated.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, do!”\\n\\n\\n\\nI wanted to, so I accepted the invitation without further ceremony.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe set out towards the house, Flora and Blunt walking ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What hair,” said Poirot to me in a low tone, nodding towards Flora.\\n\\n“The real gold! They will make a pretty couple. She and the dark,\\n\\nhandsome Captain Paton. Will they not?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI looked at him inquiringly, but he began to fuss about a few\\n\\nmicroscopic drops of water on his coat sleeve. The man reminded me in\\n\\nsome ways of a cat. His green eyes and his finicking habits.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And all for nothing, too,” I said sympathetically. “I wonder what it\\n\\nwas in the pond?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Would you like to see?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\nI stared at him. He nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My good friend,” he said gently and reproachfully, “Hercule Poirot\\n\\ndoes not run the risk of disarranging his costume without being sure\\n\\nof attaining his object. To do so would be ridiculous and absurd. I am\\n\\nnever ridiculous.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But you brought your hand out empty,” I objected.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There are times when it is necessary to have discretion. Do you tell\\n\\nyour patients everything—everything, doctor? I think not. Nor do you\\n\\ntell your excellent sister everything either, is it not so? Before\\n\\nshowing my empty hand, I dropped what it contained into my other hand.\\n\\nYou shall see what that was.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe held out his left hand, palm open. On it lay a little circlet of\\n\\ngold. A woman’s wedding ring.\\n\\n\\n\\nI took it from him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Look inside,” commanded Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\nI did so. Inside was an inscription in fine writing:—\\n\\n\\n\\n                         _From R., March 13th._\\n\\n\\n\\nI looked at Poirot, but he was busy inspecting his appearance in a tiny\\n\\npocket glass. He paid particular attention to his mustaches, and none\\n\\nat all to me. I saw that he did not intend to be communicative.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               CHAPTER X\\n\\n\\n\\n                            THE PARLORMAID\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe found Mrs. Ackroyd in the hall. With her was a small dried-up little\\n\\nman, with an aggressive chin and sharp gray eyes, and “lawyer” written\\n\\nall over him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Hammond is staying to lunch with us,” said Mrs. Ackroyd. “You know\\n\\nMajor Blunt, Mr. Hammond? And dear Dr. Sheppard—also a close friend of\\n\\npoor Roger’s. And, let me see——”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe paused, surveying Hercule Poirot in some perplexity.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This is M. Poirot, mother,” said Flora. “I told you about him this\\n\\nmorning.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! yes,” said Mrs. Ackroyd vaguely. “Of course, my dear, of course.\\n\\nHe is to find Ralph, is he not?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He is to find out who killed uncle,” said Flora.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! my dear,” cried her mother. “Please! My poor nerves. I am a wreck\\n\\nthis morning, a positive wreck. Such a dreadful thing to happen. I\\n\\ncan’t help feeling that it must have been an accident of some kind.\\n\\nRoger was so fond of handling queer curios. His hand must have slipped,\\n\\nor something.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThis theory was received in polite silence. I saw Poirot edge up to the\\n\\nlawyer, and speak to him in a confidential undertone. They moved aside\\n\\ninto the embrasure of the window. I joined them—then hesitated.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps I’m intruding,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not at all,” cried Poirot heartily. “You and I, M. le docteur, we\\n\\ninvestigate this affair side by side. Without you I should be lost. I\\n\\ndesire a little information from the good Mr. Hammond.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are acting on behalf of Captain Ralph Paton, I understand,” said\\n\\nthe lawyer cautiously.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not so. I am acting in the interests of justice. Miss Ackroyd has\\n\\nasked me to investigate the death of her uncle.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Hammond seemed slightly taken aback.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I cannot seriously believe that Captain Paton can be concerned in this\\n\\ncrime,” he said, “however strong the circumstantial evidence against\\n\\nhim may be. The mere fact that he was hard pressed for money——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Was he hard pressed for money?” interpolated Poirot quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was a chronic condition with Ralph Paton,” he said dryly. “Money\\n\\nwent through his hands like water. He was always applying to his\\n\\nstepfather.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Had he done so of late? During the last year, for instance?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I cannot say. Mr. Ackroyd did not mention the fact to me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I comprehend. Mr. Hammond, I take it that you are acquainted with the\\n\\nprovisions of Mr. Ackroyd’s will?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly. That is my principal business here to-day.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then, seeing that I am acting for Miss Ackroyd, you will not object to\\n\\ntelling me the terms of that will?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“They are quite simple. Shorn of legal phraseology, and after paying\\n\\ncertain legacies and bequests——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Such as——?” interrupted Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Hammond seemed a little surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A thousand pounds to his housekeeper, Miss Russell; fifty pounds\\n\\nto the cook, Emma Cooper; five hundred pounds to his secretary, Mr.\\n\\nGeoffrey Raymond. Then to various hospitals——”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot held up his hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! the charitable bequests, they interest me not.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite so. The income on ten thousand pounds’ worth of shares to be\\n\\npaid to Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd during her lifetime. Miss Flora Ackroyd\\n\\ninherits twenty thousand pounds outright. The residue—including this\\n\\nproperty, and the shares in Ackroyd and Son—to his adopted son, Ralph\\n\\nPaton.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Ackroyd possessed a large fortune?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A very large fortune. Captain Paton will be an exceedingly wealthy\\n\\nyoung man.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a silence. Poirot and the lawyer looked at each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Hammond,” came Mrs. Ackroyd’s voice plaintively from the fireplace.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lawyer answered the summons. Poirot took my arm and drew me right\\n\\ninto the window.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Regard the irises,” he remarked in rather a loud voice. “Magnificent,\\n\\nare they not? A straight and pleasing effect.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the same time I felt the pressure of his hand on my arm, and he\\n\\nadded in a low tone:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you really wish to aid me? To take part in this investigation?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, indeed,” I said eagerly. “There’s nothing I should like better.\\n\\nYou don’t know what a dull old fogey’s life I lead. Never anything out\\n\\nof the ordinary.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good, we will be colleagues then. In a minute or two I fancy Major\\n\\nBlunt will join us. He is not happy with the good mamma. Now there are\\n\\nsome things I want to know—but I do not wish to seem to want to know\\n\\nthem. You comprehend? So it will be your part to ask the questions.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What questions do you want me to ask?” I asked apprehensively.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I want you to introduce the name of Mrs. Ferrars.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Speak of her in a natural fashion. Ask him if he was down here when\\n\\nher husband died. You understand the kind of thing I mean. And while he\\n\\nreplies, watch his face without seeming to watch it. _C’est compris?_”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no time for more, for at that minute, as Poirot had\\n\\nprophesied, Blunt left the others in his abrupt fashion and came over\\n\\nto us.\\n\\n\\n\\nI suggested strolling on the terrace, and he acquiesced. Poirot stayed\\n\\nbehind.\\n\\n\\n\\nI stopped to examine a late rose.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How things change in the course of a day or so,” I observed. “I was\\n\\nup here last Wednesday, I remember, walking up and down this same\\n\\nterrace. Ackroyd was with me—full of spirits. And now—three days\\n\\nlater—Ackroyd’s dead, poor fellow, Mrs. Ferrars’s dead—you knew her,\\n\\ndidn’t you? But of course you did.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt nodded his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Had you seen her since you’d been down this time?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Went with Ackroyd to call. Last Tuesday, think it was. Fascinating\\n\\nwoman—but something queer about her. Deep—one would never know what she\\n\\nwas up to.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI looked into his steady gray eyes. Nothing there surely. I went on:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“I suppose you’d met her before.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Last time I was here—she and her husband had just come here to live.”\\n\\nHe paused a minute and then added: “Rum thing, she had changed a lot\\n\\nbetween then and now.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How—changed?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Looked ten years older.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Were you down here when her husband died?” I asked, trying to make the\\n\\nquestion sound as casual as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No. From all I heard it would be a good riddance. Uncharitable,\\n\\nperhaps, but the truth.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI agreed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ashley Ferrars was by no means a pattern husband,” I said cautiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Blackguard, I thought,” said Blunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” I said, “only a man with more money than was good for him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! money! All the troubles in the world can be put down to money—or\\n\\nthe lack of it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Which has been your particular trouble?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve enough for what I want. I’m one of the lucky ones.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Indeed.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m not too flush just now, as a matter of fact. Came into a legacy a\\n\\nyear ago, and like a fool let myself be persuaded into putting it into\\n\\nsome wild-cat scheme.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI sympathized, and narrated my own similar trouble.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the gong pealed out, and we all went in to lunch. Poirot drew me\\n\\nback a little.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Eh! bien?_”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He’s all right,” I said. “I’m sure of it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing—disturbing?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He had a legacy just a year ago,” I said. “But why not? Why shouldn’t\\n\\nhe? I’ll swear the man is perfectly square and aboveboard.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Without doubt, without doubt,” said Poirot soothingly. “Do not upset\\n\\nyourself.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe spoke as though to a fractious child.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe all trooped into the dining-room. It seemed incredible that less\\n\\nthan twenty-four hours had passed since I last sat at that table.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfterwards, Mrs. Ackroyd took me aside and sat down with me on a sofa.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can’t help feeling a little hurt,” she murmured, producing a\\n\\nhandkerchief of the kind obviously not meant to be cried into. “Hurt,\\n\\nI mean, by Roger’s lack of confidence in me. That twenty thousand\\n\\npounds ought to have been left to _me_—not to Flora. A mother could be\\n\\ntrusted to safeguard the interests of her child. A lack of trust, I\\n\\ncall it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You forget, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said, “Flora was Ackroyd’s own niece, a\\n\\nblood relation. It would have been different had you been his sister\\n\\ninstead of his sister-in-law.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“As poor Cecil’s widow, I think my feelings ought to have been\\n\\nconsidered,” said the lady, touching her eye-lashes gingerly with\\n\\nthe handkerchief. “But Roger was always most peculiar—not to say\\n\\n_mean_—about money matters. It has been a most difficult position\\n\\nfor both Flora and myself. He did not even give the poor child an\\n\\nallowance. He would pay her bills, you know, and even that with a good\\n\\ndeal of reluctance and asking what she wanted all those fal-lals for—so\\n\\nlike a man—but—now I’ve forgotten what it was I was going to say!\\n\\nOh, yes, not a penny we could call our own, you know. Flora resented\\n\\nit—yes, I must say she resented it—very strongly. Though devoted to\\n\\nher uncle, of course. But any girl would have resented it. Yes, I must\\n\\nsay Roger had very strange ideas about money. He wouldn’t even buy new\\n\\nface towels, though I told him the old ones were in holes. And then,”\\n\\nproceeded Mrs. Ackroyd, with a sudden leap highly characteristic of\\n\\nher conversation, “to leave all that money—a thousand pounds—fancy, a\\n\\nthousand pounds!—to that woman.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What woman?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That Russell woman. Something very queer about her, and so I’ve always\\n\\nsaid. But Roger wouldn’t hear a word against her. Said she was a woman\\n\\nof great force of character, and that he admired and respected her.\\n\\nHe was always going on about her rectitude and independence and moral\\n\\nworth. _I_ think there’s something fishy about her. She was certainly\\n\\ndoing her best to marry Roger. But I soon put a stop to that. She’s\\n\\nalways hated me. Naturally. _I_ saw through her.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI began to wonder if there was any chance of stemming Mrs. Ackroyd’s\\n\\neloquence, and getting away.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Hammond provided the necessary diversion by coming up to say\\n\\ngood-by. I seized my chance and rose also.\\n\\n\\n\\n“About the inquest,” I said. “Where would you prefer it to be held.\\n\\nHere, or at the Three Boars?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd stared at me with a dropped jaw.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The inquest?” she asked, the picture of consternation. “But surely\\n\\nthere won’t have to be an inquest?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Hammond gave a dry little cough and murmured, “Inevitable. Under\\n\\nthe circumstances,” in two short little barks.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But surely Dr. Sheppard can arrange——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“There are limits to my powers of arrangement,” I said dryly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If his death was an accident——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He was murdered, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said brutally.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe gave a little cry.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No theory of accident will hold water for a minute.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd looked at me in distress. I had no patience with what I\\n\\nthought was her silly fear of unpleasantness.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If there’s an inquest, I—I shan’t have to answer questions and all\\n\\nthat, shall I?” she asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know what will be necessary,” I answered. “I imagine\\n\\nMr. Raymond will take the brunt of it off you. He knows all the\\n\\ncircumstances, and can give formal evidence of identification.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lawyer assented with a little bow.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I really don’t think there is anything to dread, Mrs. Ackroyd,” he\\n\\nsaid. “You will be spared all unpleasantness. Now, as to the question\\n\\nof money, have you all you need for the present? I mean,” he added, as\\n\\nshe looked at him inquiringly, “ready money. Cash, you know. If not, I\\n\\ncan arrange to let you have whatever you require.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That ought to be all right,” said Raymond, who was standing by. “Mr.\\n\\nAckroyd cashed a cheque for a hundred pounds yesterday.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A hundred pounds?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes. For wages and other expenses due to-day. At the moment it is\\n\\nstill intact.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where is this money? In his desk?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, he always kept his cash in his bedroom. In an old collar-box, to\\n\\nbe accurate. Funny idea, wasn’t it?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think,” said the lawyer, “we ought to make sure the money is there\\n\\nbefore I leave.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly,” agreed the secretary. “I’ll take you up now.... Oh! I\\n\\nforgot. The door’s locked.”\\n\\n\\n\\nInquiry from Parker elicited the information that Inspector Raglan was\\n\\nin the housekeeper’s room asking a few supplementary questions. A few\\n\\nminutes later the inspector joined the party in the hall, bringing the\\n\\nkey with him. He unlocked the door and we passed into the lobby and up\\n\\nthe small staircase. At the top of the stairs the door into Ackroyd’s\\n\\nbedroom stood open. Inside the room it was dark, the curtains were\\n\\ndrawn, and the bed was turned down just as it had been last night. The\\n\\ninspector drew the curtains, letting in the sunlight, and Geoffrey\\n\\nRaymond went to the top drawer of a rosewood bureau.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He kept his money like that, in an unlocked drawer. Just fancy,”\\n\\ncommented the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe secretary flushed a little.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Ackroyd had perfect faith in the honesty of all the servants,” he\\n\\nsaid hotly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! quite so,” said the inspector hastily.\\n\\n\\n\\nRaymond opened the drawer, took out a round leather collar-box from the\\n\\nback of it, and opening it, drew out a thick wallet.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Here is the money,” he said, taking out a fat roll of notes. “You\\n\\nwill find the hundred intact, I know, for Mr. Ackroyd put it in the\\n\\ncollar-box in my presence last night when he was dressing for dinner,\\n\\nand of course it has not been touched since.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Hammond took the roll from him and counted it. He looked up sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A hundred pounds, you said. But there is only sixty here.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRaymond stared at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Impossible,” he cried, springing forward. Taking the notes from the\\n\\nother’s hand, he counted them aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Hammond had been right. The total amounted to sixty pounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But—I can’t understand it,” cried the secretary, bewildered.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot asked a question.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You saw Mr. Ackroyd put this money away last night when he was\\n\\ndressing for dinner? You are sure he had not paid away any of it\\n\\nalready?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m sure he hadn’t. He even said, ‘I don’t want to take a hundred\\n\\npounds down to dinner with me. Too bulgy.’”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then the affair is very simple,” remarked Poirot. “Either he paid out\\n\\nthat forty pounds sometime last evening, or else it has been stolen.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s the matter in a nutshell,” agreed the inspector. He turned\\n\\nto Mrs. Ackroyd. “Which of the servants would come in here yesterday\\n\\nevening?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I suppose the housemaid would turn down the bed.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who is she? What do you know about her?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She’s not been here very long,” said Mrs. Ackroyd. “But she’s a nice\\n\\nordinary country girl.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think we ought to clear this matter up,” said the inspector. “If\\n\\nMr. Ackroyd paid that money away himself, it may have a bearing on the\\n\\nmystery of the crime. The other servants all right, as far as you know?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, I think so.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not missed anything before?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“None of them leaving, or anything like that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The parlormaid is leaving.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“When?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She gave notice yesterday, I believe.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“To you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no. _I_ have nothing to do with the servants. Miss Russell attends\\n\\nto the household matters.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector remained lost in thought for a minute or two. Then he\\n\\nnodded his head and remarked, “I think I’d better have a word with Miss\\n\\nRussell, and I’ll see the girl Dale as well.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot and I accompanied him to the housekeeper’s room. Miss Russell\\n\\nreceived us with her usual sang-froid.\\n\\n\\n\\nElsie Dale had been at Fernly five months. A nice girl, quick at her\\n\\nduties, and most respectable. Good references. The last girl in the\\n\\nworld to take anything not belonging to her.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat about the parlormaid?\\n\\n\\n\\n“She, too, was a most superior girl. Very quiet and ladylike. An\\n\\nexcellent worker.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then why is she leaving?” asked the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\nMiss Russell pursed up her lips.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was none of my doing. I understand Mr. Ackroyd found fault with\\n\\nher yesterday afternoon. It was her duty to do the study, and she\\n\\ndisarranged some of the papers on his desk, I believe. He was very\\n\\nannoyed about it, and she gave notice. At least, that is what I\\n\\nunderstood from her, but perhaps you’d like to see her yourselves?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector assented. I had already noticed the girl when she was\\n\\nwaiting on us at lunch. A tall girl, with a lot of brown hair rolled\\n\\ntightly away at the back of her neck, and very steady gray eyes. She\\n\\ncame in answer to the housekeeper’s summons, and stood very straight\\n\\nwith those same gray eyes fixed on us.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are Ursula Bourne?” asked the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I understand you are leaving?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why is that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I disarranged some papers on Mr. Ackroyd’s desk. He was very angry\\n\\nabout it, and I said I had better leave. He told me to go as soon as\\n\\npossible.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Were you in Mr. Ackroyd’s bedroom at all last night? Tidying up or\\n\\nanything?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, sir. That is Elsie’s work. I never went near that part of the\\n\\nhouse.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I must tell you, my girl, that a large sum of money is missing from\\n\\nMr. Ackroyd’s room.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last I saw her roused. A wave of color swept over her face.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know nothing about any money. If you think I took it, and that that\\n\\nis why Mr. Ackroyd dismissed me, you are wrong.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m not accusing you of taking it, my girl,” said the inspector.\\n\\n“Don’t flare up so.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe girl looked at him coldly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You can search my things if you like,” she said disdainfully. “But you\\n\\nwon’t find anything.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot suddenly interposed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was yesterday afternoon that Mr. Ackroyd dismissed you—or you\\n\\ndismissed yourself, was it not?” he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe girl nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How long did the interview last?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The interview?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, the interview between you and Mr. Ackroyd in the study?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I—I don’t know.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Twenty minutes? Half an hour?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Something like that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not longer?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not longer than half an hour, certainly.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, mademoiselle.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI looked curiously at him. He was rearranging a few objects on the\\n\\ntable, setting them straight with precise fingers. His eyes were\\n\\nshining.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’ll do,” said the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\nUrsula Bourne disappeared. The inspector turned to Miss Russell.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How long has she been here? Have you got a copy of the reference you\\n\\nhad with her?”\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout answering the first question, Miss Russell moved to an adjacent\\n\\nbureau, opened one of the drawers, and took out a handful of letters\\n\\nclipped together with a patent fastener. She selected one and handed it\\n\\nto the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\n“H’m,” said he. “Reads all right. Mrs. Richard Folliott, Marby Grange,\\n\\nMarby. Who’s this woman?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite good county people,” said Miss Russell.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said the inspector, handing it back, “let’s have a look at the\\n\\nother one, Elsie Dale.”\\n\\n\\n\\nElsie Dale was a big fair girl, with a pleasant but slightly stupid\\n\\nface. She answered our questions readily enough, and showed much\\n\\ndistress and concern at the loss of the money.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with her,” observed the\\n\\ninspector, after he had dismissed her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What about Parker?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMiss Russell pursed her lips together and made no reply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve a feeling there’s something wrong about that man,” the inspector\\n\\ncontinued thoughtfully. “The trouble is that I don’t quite see when he\\n\\ngot his opportunity. He’d be busy with his duties immediately after\\n\\ndinner, and he’s got a pretty good alibi all through the evening. I\\n\\nknow, for I’ve been devoting particular attention to it. Well, thank\\n\\nyou very much, Miss Russell. We’ll leave things as they are for the\\n\\npresent. It’s highly probable Mr. Ackroyd paid that money away himself.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe housekeeper bade us a dry good-afternoon, and we took our leave.\\n\\n\\n\\nI left the house with Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wonder,” I said, breaking the silence, “what the papers the girl\\n\\ndisarranged could have been for Ackroyd to have got into such a state\\n\\nabout them? I wonder if there is any clew there to the mystery.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The secretary said there were no papers of particular importance on\\n\\nthe desk,” said Poirot quietly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, but——” I paused.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It strikes you as odd that Ackroyd should have flown into a rage about\\n\\nso trivial a matter?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, it does rather.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But was it a trivial matter?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course,” I admitted, “we don’t know what those papers may have\\n\\nbeen. But Raymond certainly said——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Leave M. Raymond out of it for a minute. What did you think of that\\n\\ngirl?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Which girl? The parlormaid?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, the parlormaid. Ursula Bourne.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She seemed a nice girl,” I said hesitatingly.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot repeated my words, but whereas I had laid a slight stress on the\\n\\nfourth word, he put it on the second.\\n\\n\\n\\n“She _seemed_ a nice girl—yes.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, after a minute’s silence, he took something from his pocket and\\n\\nhanded it to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“See, my friend, I will show you something. Look there.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe paper he had handed me was that compiled by the inspector and given\\n\\nby him to Poirot that morning. Following the pointing finger, I saw a\\n\\nsmall cross marked in pencil opposite the name Ursula Bourne.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You may not have noticed it at the time, my good friend, but there was\\n\\none person on this list whose alibi had no kind of confirmation. Ursula\\n\\nBourne.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don’t think——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dr. Sheppard, I dare to think anything. Ursula Bourne may have killed\\n\\nMr. Ackroyd, but I confess I can see no motive for her doing so. Can\\n\\nyou?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked at me very hard—so hard that I felt uncomfortable.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Can you?” he repeated.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No motive whatsoever,” I said firmly.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis gaze relaxed. He frowned and murmured to himself:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Since the blackmailer was a man, it follows that she cannot be the\\n\\nblackmailer, then——”\\n\\n\\n\\nI coughed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As far as that goes——” I began doubtfully.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe spun round on me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What? What are you going to say?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing. Nothing. Only that, strictly speaking, Mrs. Ferrars in her\\n\\nletter mentioned a _person_—she didn’t actually specify a man. But we\\n\\ntook it for granted, Ackroyd and I, that it _was_ a man.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot did not seem to be listening to me. He was muttering to himself\\n\\nagain.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But then it is possible after all—yes, certainly it is possible—but\\n\\nthen—ah! I must rearrange my ideas. Method, order; never have I needed\\n\\nthem more. Everything must fit in—in its appointed place—otherwise I am\\n\\non the wrong tack.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe broke off, and whirled round upon me again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where is Marby?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s on the other side of Cranchester.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How far away?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh!—fourteen miles, perhaps.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Would it be possible for you to go there? To-morrow, say?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“To-morrow? Let me see, that’s Sunday. Yes, I could arrange it. What do\\n\\nyou want me to do there?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“See this Mrs. Folliott. Find out all you can about Ursula Bourne.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very well. But—I don’t much care for the job.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is not the time to make difficulties. A man’s life may hang on\\n\\nthis.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Poor Ralph,” I said with a sigh. “You believe him to be innocent,\\n\\nthough?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot looked at me very gravely.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you want to know the truth?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then you shall have it. My friend, everything points to the assumption\\n\\nthat he is guilty.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, that stupid inspector—for he is stupid—has everything pointing\\n\\nhis way. I seek for the truth—and the truth leads me every time to\\n\\nRalph Paton. Motive, opportunity, means. But I will leave no stone\\n\\nunturned. I promised Mademoiselle Flora. And she was very sure, that\\n\\nlittle one. But very sure indeed.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\n\\n                          POIROT PAYS A CALL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI was slightly nervous when I rang the bell at Marby Grange the\\n\\nfollowing afternoon. I wondered very much what Poirot expected to\\n\\nfind out. He had entrusted the job to me. Why? Was it because, as\\n\\nin the case of questioning Major Blunt, he wished to remain in the\\n\\nbackground? The wish, intelligible in the first case, seemed to me\\n\\nquite meaningless here.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy meditations were interrupted by the advent of a smart parlormaid.\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, Mrs. Folliott was at home. I was ushered into a big drawing-room,\\n\\nand looked round me curiously as I waited for the mistress of the\\n\\nhouse. A large bare room, some good bits of old china, and some\\n\\nbeautiful etchings, shabby covers and curtains. A lady’s room in every\\n\\nsense of the term.\\n\\n\\n\\nI turned from the inspection of a Bartolozzi on the wall as Mrs.\\n\\nFolliott came into the room. She was a tall woman, with untidy brown\\n\\nhair, and a very winning smile.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dr. Sheppard,” she said hesitatingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is my name,” I replied. “I must apologize for calling upon you\\n\\nlike this, but I wanted some information about a parlormaid previously\\n\\nemployed by you, Ursula Bourne.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the utterance of the name the smile vanished from her face, and\\n\\nall the cordiality froze out of her manner. She looked uncomfortable\\n\\nand ill at ease.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ursula Bourne?” she said hesitatingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I said. “Perhaps you don’t remember the name?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, yes, of course. I—I remember perfectly.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She left you just over a year ago, I understand?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes. Yes, she did. That is quite right.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And you were satisfied with her whilst she was with you? How long was\\n\\nshe with you, by the way?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! a year or two—I can’t remember exactly how long. She—she is very\\n\\ncapable. I’m sure you will find her quite satisfactory. I didn’t know\\n\\nshe was leaving Fernly. I hadn’t the least idea of it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Can you tell me anything about her?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Anything about her?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, where she comes from, who her people are—that sort of thing?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Folliott’s face wore more than ever its frozen look.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know at all.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who was she with before she came to you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m afraid I don’t remember.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a spark of anger now underlying her nervousness. She flung up\\n\\nher head in a gesture that was vaguely familiar.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is it really necessary to ask all these questions?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not at all,” I said, with an air of surprise and a tinge of apology\\n\\nin my manner. “I had no idea you would mind answering them. I am very\\n\\nsorry.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHer anger left her and she became confused again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! I don’t mind answering them. I assure you I don’t. Why should I?\\n\\nIt—it just seemed a little odd, you know. That’s all. A little odd.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOne advantage of being a medical practitioner is that you can usually\\n\\ntell when people are lying to you. I should have known from Mrs.\\n\\nFolliott’s manner, if from nothing else, that she did mind answering my\\n\\nquestions—minded intensely. She was thoroughly uncomfortable and upset,\\n\\nand there was plainly some mystery in the background. I judged her to\\n\\nbe a woman quite unused to deception of any kind, and consequently\\n\\nrendered acutely uneasy when forced to practice it. A child could have\\n\\nseen through her.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it was also clear that she had no intention of telling me anything\\n\\nfurther. Whatever the mystery centering around Ursula Bourne might be,\\n\\nI was not going to learn it through Mrs. Folliott.\\n\\n\\n\\nDefeated, I apologized once more for disturbing her, took my hat and\\n\\ndeparted.\\n\\n\\n\\nI went to see a couple of patients and arrived home about six o’clock.\\n\\nCaroline was sitting beside the wreck of tea things. She had that\\n\\nlook of suppressed exultation on her face which I know only too well.\\n\\nIt is a sure sign with her, of either the getting or the giving of\\n\\ninformation. I wondered which it had been.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve had a very interesting afternoon,” began Caroline as I dropped\\n\\ninto my own particular easy chair, and stretched out my feet to the\\n\\ninviting blaze in the fireplace.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Have you?” I asked. “Miss Ganett drop in to tea?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMiss Ganett is one of the chief of our newsmongers.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Guess again,” said Caroline with intense complacency.\\n\\n\\n\\nI guessed several times, working slowly through all the members of\\n\\nCaroline’s Intelligence Corps. My sister received each guess with\\n\\na triumphant shake of the head. In the end she volunteered the\\n\\ninformation herself.\\n\\n\\n\\n“M. Poirot!” she said. “Now what do you think of that?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI thought a good many things of it, but I was careful not to say them\\n\\nto Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why did he come?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“To see me, of course. He said that knowing my brother so well, he\\n\\nhoped he might be permitted to make the acquaintance of his charming\\n\\nsister—your charming sister, I’ve got mixed up, but you know what I\\n\\nmean.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What did he talk about?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He told me a lot about himself and his cases. You know that Prince\\n\\nPaul of Mauretania—the one who’s just married a dancer?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I saw a most intriguing paragraph about her in Society Snippets the\\n\\nother day, hinting that she was really a Russian Grand Duchess—one\\n\\nof the Czar’s daughters who managed to escape from the Bolsheviks.\\n\\nWell, it seems that M. Poirot solved a baffling murder mystery that\\n\\nthreatened to involve them both. Prince Paul was beside himself with\\n\\ngratitude.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did he give him an emerald tie pin the size of a plover’s egg?” I\\n\\ninquired sarcastically.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He didn’t mention it. Why?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing,” I said. “I thought it was always done. It is in detective\\n\\nfiction anyway. The super detective always has his rooms littered with\\n\\nrubies and pearls and emeralds from grateful Royal clients.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s very interesting to hear about these things from the inside,”\\n\\nsaid my sister complacently.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt would be—to Caroline. I could not but admire the ingenuity of M.\\n\\nHercule Poirot, who had selected unerringly the case of all others that\\n\\nwould most appeal to an elderly maiden lady living in a small village.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did he tell you if the dancer was really a Grand Duchess?” I inquired.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He was not at liberty to speak,” said Caroline importantly.\\n\\n\\n\\nI wondered how far Poirot had strained the truth in talking to\\n\\nCaroline—probably not at all. He had conveyed his innuendoes by means\\n\\nof his eyebrows and his shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And after all this,” I remarked, “I suppose you were ready to eat out\\n\\nof his hand.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t be coarse, James. I don’t know where you get these vulgar\\n\\nexpressions from.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Probably from my only link with the outside world—my patients.\\n\\nUnfortunately my practice does not lie amongst Royal princes and\\n\\ninteresting Russian émigrés.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline pushed her spectacles up and looked at me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You seem very grumpy, James. It must be your liver. A blue pill, I\\n\\nthink, to-night.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTo see me in my own home, you would never imagine that I was a doctor\\n\\nof medicine. Caroline does the home prescribing both for herself and me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Damn my liver,” I said irritably. “Did you talk about the murder at\\n\\nall?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, naturally, James. What else is there to talk about locally?\\n\\nI was able to set M. Poirot right upon several points. He was very\\n\\ngrateful to me. He said I had the makings of a born detective in me—and\\n\\na wonderful psychological insight into human nature.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline was exactly like a cat that is full to overflowing with rich\\n\\ncream. She was positively purring.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He talked a lot about the little gray cells of the brain, and of their\\n\\nfunctions. His own, he says, are of the first quality.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He would say so,” I remarked bitterly. “Modesty is certainly not his\\n\\nmiddle name.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wish you would not be so horribly American, James. He thought it\\n\\nvery important that Ralph should be found as soon as possible, and\\n\\ninduced to come forward and give an account of himself. He says that\\n\\nhis disappearance will produce a very unfortunate impression at the\\n\\ninquest.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And what did you say to that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I agreed with him,” said Caroline importantly. “And I was able to tell\\n\\nhim the way people were already talking about it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Caroline,” I said sharply, “did you tell M. Poirot what you overheard\\n\\nin the wood that day?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I did,” said Caroline complacently.\\n\\n\\n\\nI got up and began to walk about.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You realize what you’re doing, I hope,” I jerked out. “You’re putting\\n\\na halter round Ralph Paton’s neck as surely as you’re sitting in that\\n\\nchair.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not at all,” said Caroline, quite unruffled. “I was surprised _you_\\n\\nhadn’t told him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I took very good care not to,” I said. “I’m fond of that boy.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“So am I. That’s why I say you’re talking nonsense. I don’t believe\\n\\nRalph did it, and so the truth can’t hurt him, and we ought to give M.\\n\\nPoirot all the help we can. Why, think, very likely Ralph was out with\\n\\nthat identical girl on the night of the murder, and if so, he’s got a\\n\\nperfect alibi.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If he’s got a perfect alibi,” I retorted, “why doesn’t he come forward\\n\\nand say so?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Might get the girl into trouble,” said Caroline sapiently. “But if M.\\n\\nPoirot gets hold of her, and puts it to her as her duty, she’ll come\\n\\nforward of her own accord and clear Ralph.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You seem to have invented a romantic fairy story of your own,” I said.\\n\\n“You read too many trashy novels, Caroline. I’ve always told you so.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI dropped into my chair again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did Poirot ask you any more questions?” I inquired.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Only about the patients you had that morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The patients?” I demanded, unbelievingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, your surgery patients. How many and who they were?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you mean to say you were able to tell him that?” I demanded.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline is really amazing.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why not?” asked my sister triumphantly. “I can see the path up to the\\n\\nsurgery door perfectly from this window. And I’ve got an excellent\\n\\nmemory, James. Much better than yours, let me tell you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m sure you have,” I murmured mechanically.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy sister went on, checking the names on her fingers.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There was old Mrs. Bennett, and that boy from the farm with the bad\\n\\nfinger, Dolly Grice to have a needle out of her finger; that American\\n\\nsteward off the liner. Let me see—that’s four. Yes, and old George\\n\\nEvans with his ulcer. And lastly——”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe paused significantly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline brought out her climax triumphantly. She hissed in the most\\n\\napproved style—aided by the fortunate number of s’s at her disposal.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Miss Russell!_”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe sat back in her chair and looked at me meaningly, and when Caroline\\n\\nlooks at you meaningly, it is impossible to miss it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know what you mean,” I said, quite untruthfully. “Why\\n\\nshouldn’t Miss Russell consult me about her bad knee?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Bad knee,” said Caroline. “Fiddlesticks! No more bad knee than you and\\n\\nI. She was after something else.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline had to admit that she didn’t know.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But depend upon it, that was what he was trying to get at, M. Poirot,\\n\\nI mean. There’s something fishy about that woman, and he knows it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Precisely the remark Mrs. Ackroyd made to me yesterday,” I said. “That\\n\\nthere was something fishy about Miss Russell.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” said Caroline darkly, “Mrs. Ackroyd! There’s another!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Another what?”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline refused to explain her remarks. She merely nodded her head\\n\\nseveral times, rolled up her knitting, and went upstairs to don the\\n\\nhigh mauve silk blouse and the gold locket which she calls dressing for\\n\\ndinner.\\n\\n\\n\\nI stayed there staring into the fire and thinking over Caroline’s\\n\\nwords. Had Poirot really come to gain information about Miss Russell,\\n\\nor was it only Caroline’s tortuous mind that interpreted everything\\n\\naccording to her own ideas?\\n\\n\\n\\nThere had certainly been nothing in Miss Russell’s manner that morning\\n\\nto arouse suspicion. At least——\\n\\n\\n\\nI remembered her persistent conversation on the subject of drug-taking\\n\\nand from that she had led the conversation to poisons and poisoning.\\n\\nBut there was nothing in that. Ackroyd had not been poisoned. Still, it\\n\\nwas odd....\\n\\n\\n\\nI heard Caroline’s voice, rather acid in note, calling from the top of\\n\\nthe stairs.\\n\\n\\n\\n“James, you will be late for dinner.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI put some coal on the fire and went upstairs obediently.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is well at any price to have peace in the home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\n\\n                            ROUND THE TABLE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA joint inquest was held on Monday.\\n\\n\\n\\nI do not propose to give the proceedings in detail. To do so would only\\n\\nbe to go over the same ground again and again. By arrangement with the\\n\\npolice, very little was allowed to come out. I gave evidence as to the\\n\\ncause of Ackroyd’s death and the probable time. The absence of Ralph\\n\\nPaton was commented on by the coroner, but not unduly stressed.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfterwards, Poirot and I had a few words with Inspector Raglan. The\\n\\ninspector was very grave.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It looks bad, Mr. Poirot,” he said. “I’m trying to judge the thing\\n\\nfair and square. I’m a local man, and I’ve seen Captain Paton many\\n\\ntimes in Cranchester. I’m not wanting him to be the guilty one—but it’s\\n\\nbad whichever way you look at it. If he’s innocent, why doesn’t he come\\n\\nforward? We’ve got evidence against him, but it’s just possible that\\n\\nthat evidence could be explained away. Then why doesn’t he give an\\n\\nexplanation?”\\n\\n\\n\\nA lot more lay behind the inspector’s words than I knew at the time.\\n\\nRalph’s description had been wired to every port and railway station\\n\\nin England. The police everywhere were on the alert. His rooms in town\\n\\nwere watched, and any houses he had been known to be in the habit\\n\\nof frequenting. With such a _cordon_ it seemed impossible that Ralph\\n\\nshould be able to evade detection. He had no luggage, and, as far as\\n\\nany one knew, no money.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can’t find any one who saw him at the station that night,” continued\\n\\nthe inspector. “And yet he’s well known down here, and you’d think\\n\\nsomebody would have noticed him. There’s no news from Liverpool either.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You think he went to Liverpool?” queried Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, it’s on the cards. That telephone message from the station,\\n\\njust three minutes before the Liverpool express left—there ought to be\\n\\nsomething in that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Unless it was deliberately intended to throw you off the scent. That\\n\\nmight just possibly be the point of the telephone message.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s an idea,” said the inspector eagerly. “Do you really think\\n\\nthat’s the explanation of the telephone call?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My friend,” said Poirot gravely, “I do not know. But I will tell you\\n\\nthis: I believe that when we find the explanation of that telephone\\n\\ncall we shall find the explanation of the murder.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You said something like that before, I remember,” I observed, looking\\n\\nat him curiously.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I always come back to it,” he said seriously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It seems to me utterly irrelevant,” I declared.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wouldn’t say that,” demurred the inspector. “But I must confess I\\n\\nthink Mr. Poirot here harps on it a little too much. We’ve better clews\\n\\nthan that. The fingerprints on the dagger, for instance.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot became suddenly very foreign in manner, as he often did when\\n\\nexcited over anything.\\n\\n\\n\\n“M. l’Inspecteur,” he said, “beware of the blind—the blind—_comment\\n\\ndire?_—the little street that has no end to it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nInspector Raglan stared, but I was quicker.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You mean a blind alley?” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is it—the blind street that leads nowhere. So it may be with\\n\\nthose fingerprints—they may lead you nowhere.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t see how that can well be,” said the police officer. “I suppose\\n\\nyou’re hinting that they’re faked? I’ve read of such things being done,\\n\\nthough I can’t say I’ve ever come across it in my experience. But fake\\n\\nor true—they’re bound to lead _somewhere_.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot merely shrugged his shoulders, flinging out his arms wide.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector then showed us various enlarged photographs of the\\n\\nfingerprints, and proceeded to become technical on the subject of loops\\n\\nand whorls.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come now,” he said at last, annoyed by Poirot’s detached manner,\\n\\n“you’ve got to admit that those prints were made by some one who was in\\n\\nthe house that night?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Bien entendu_,” said Poirot, nodding his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, I’ve taken the prints of every member of the household, every\\n\\none, mind you, from the old lady down to the kitchenmaid.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t think Mrs. Ackroyd would enjoy being referred to as the old\\n\\nlady. She must spend a considerable amount on cosmetics.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Every one’s,” repeated the inspector fussily.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Including mine,” I said dryly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very well. None of them correspond. That leaves us two alternatives.\\n\\nRalph Paton, or the mysterious stranger the doctor here tells us about.\\n\\nWhen we get hold of those two——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Much valuable time may have been lost,” broke in Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t quite get you, Mr. Poirot?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have taken the prints of every one in the house, you say,”\\n\\nmurmured Poirot. “Is that the exact truth you are telling me there, M.\\n\\nl’Inspecteur?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Without overlooking any one?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Without overlooking any one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The quick or the dead?”\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment the inspector looked bewildered at what he took to be a\\n\\nreligious observation. Then he reacted slowly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You mean——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The dead, M. l’Inspecteur.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector still took a minute or two to understand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am suggesting,” said Poirot placidly, “that the fingerprints on the\\n\\ndagger handle are those of Mr. Ackroyd himself. It is an easy matter to\\n\\nverify. His body is still available.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But why? What would be the point of it? You’re surely not suggesting\\n\\nsuicide, Mr. Poirot?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! no. My theory is that the murderer wore gloves or wrapped\\n\\nsomething round his hand. After the blow was struck, he picked up the\\n\\nvictim’s hand and closed it round the dagger handle.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But why?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“To make a confusing case even more confusing.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said the inspector, “I’ll look into it. What gave you the idea\\n\\nin the first place?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“When you were so kind as to show me the dagger and draw attention to\\n\\nthe fingerprints. I know very little of loops and whorls—see, I confess\\n\\nmy ignorance frankly. But it did occur to me that the position of the\\n\\nprints was somewhat awkward. Not so would I have held a dagger in order\\n\\nto strike. Naturally, with the right hand brought up over the shoulder\\n\\nbackwards, it would have been difficult to put it in exactly the right\\n\\nposition.”\\n\\n\\n\\nInspector Raglan stared at the little man. Poirot, with an air of great\\n\\nunconcern, flecked a speck of dust from his coat sleeve.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said the inspector, “it’s an idea. I’ll look into it all right,\\n\\nbut don’t you be disappointed if nothing comes of it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe endeavored to make his tone kindly and patronizing. Poirot watched\\n\\nhim go off. Then he turned to me with twinkling eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Another time,” he observed, “I must be more careful of his _amour\\n\\npropre_. And now that we are left to our own devices, what do you\\n\\nthink, my good friend, of a little reunion of the family?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe “little reunion,” as Poirot called it, took place about half an\\n\\nhour later. We sat round the table in the dining-room at Fernly—Poirot\\n\\nat the head of the table, like the chairman of some ghastly board\\n\\nmeeting. The servants were not present, so we were six in all. Mrs.\\n\\nAckroyd, Flora, Major Blunt, young Raymond, Poirot, and myself.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen every one was assembled, Poirot rose and bowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Messieurs, mesdames, I have called you together for a certain\\n\\npurpose.” He paused. “To begin with, I want to make a very special plea\\n\\nto mademoiselle.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“To me?” said Flora.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mademoiselle, you are engaged to Captain Ralph Paton. If any one\\n\\nis in his confidence, you are. I beg you, most earnestly, if you\\n\\nknow of his whereabouts, to persuade him to come forward. One little\\n\\nminute”—as Flora raised her head to speak—“say nothing till you have\\n\\nwell reflected. Mademoiselle, his position grows daily more dangerous.\\n\\nIf he had come forward at once, no matter how damning the facts, he\\n\\nmight have had a chance of explaining them away. But this silence—this\\n\\nflight—what can it mean? Surely only one thing, knowledge of guilt.\\n\\nMademoiselle, if you really believe in his innocence, persuade him to\\n\\ncome forward before it is too late.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora’s face had gone very white.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Too late!” she repeated, very low.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot leant forward, looking at her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“See now, mademoiselle,” he said very gently, “it is Papa Poirot who\\n\\nasks you this. The old Papa Poirot who has much knowledge and much\\n\\nexperience. I would not seek to entrap you, mademoiselle. Will you not\\n\\ntrust me—and tell me where Ralph Paton is hiding?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe girl rose, and stood facing him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“M. Poirot,” she said in a clear voice, “I swear to you—swear\\n\\nsolemnly—that I have no idea where Ralph is, and that I have neither\\n\\nseen him nor heard from him either on the day of—of the murder, or\\n\\nsince.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe sat down again. Poirot gazed at her in silence for a minute or two,\\n\\nthen he brought his hand down on the table with a sharp rap.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Bien!_ That is that,” he said. His face hardened. “Now I appeal to\\n\\nthese others who sit round this table, Mrs. Ackroyd, Major Blunt, Dr.\\n\\nSheppard, Mr. Raymond. You are all friends and intimates of the missing\\n\\nman. If you know where Ralph Paton is hiding, speak out.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a long silence. Poirot looked to each in turn.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I beg of you,” he said in a low voice, “speak out.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBut still there was silence, broken at last by Mrs. Ackroyd.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I must say,” she observed in a plaintive voice, “that Ralph’s absence\\n\\nis most peculiar—most peculiar indeed. Not to come forward at such a\\n\\ntime. It looks, you know, as though there were something _behind_ it.\\n\\nI can’t help thinking, Flora dear, that it was a very fortunate thing\\n\\nyour engagement was never formally announced.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mother!” cried Flora angrily.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Providence,” declared Mrs. Ackroyd. “I have a devout belief in\\n\\nProvidence—a divinity that shapes our ends, as Shakespeare’s beautiful\\n\\nline runs.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Surely you don’t make the Almighty directly responsible for\\n\\nthick ankles, Mrs. Ackroyd, do you?” asked Geoffrey Raymond, his\\n\\nirresponsible laugh ringing out.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis idea was, I think, to loosen the tension, but Mrs. Ackroyd threw\\n\\nhim a glance of reproach and took out her handkerchief.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Flora has been saved a terrible amount of notoriety and\\n\\nunpleasantness. Not for a moment that I think dear Ralph had anything\\n\\nto do with poor Roger’s death. I _don’t_ think so. But then I have a\\n\\ntrusting heart—I always have had, ever since a child. I am loath to\\n\\nbelieve the worst of any one. But, of course, one must remember that\\n\\nRalph was in several air raids as a young boy. The results are apparent\\n\\nlong after, sometimes, they say. People are not responsible for their\\n\\nactions in the least. They lose control, you know, without being able\\n\\nto help it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mother,” cried Flora, “you don’t think Ralph did it?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come, Mrs. Ackroyd,” said Blunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know what to think,” said Mrs. Ackroyd tearfully. “It’s all\\n\\nvery upsetting. What would happen to the estate, I wonder, if Ralph\\n\\nwere found guilty?”\\n\\n\\n\\nRaymond pushed his chair away from the table violently. Major Blunt\\n\\nremained very quiet, looking thoughtfully at her. “Like shell-shock,\\n\\nyou know,” said Mrs. Ackroyd obstinately, “and I dare say Roger kept\\n\\nhim very short of money—with the best intentions, of course. I can see\\n\\nyou are all against me, but I do think it is very odd that Ralph has\\n\\nnot come forward, and I must say I am thankful Flora’s engagement was\\n\\nnever announced formally.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It will be to-morrow,” said Flora in a clear voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Flora!” cried her mother, aghast.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora had turned to the secretary.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Will you send the announcement to the _Morning Post_ and the _Times_,\\n\\nplease, Mr. Raymond.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you are sure that it is wise, Miss Ackroyd,” he replied gravely.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe turned impulsively to Blunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You understand,” she said. “What else can I do? As things are, I must\\n\\nstand by Ralph. Don’t you see that I must?”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe looked very searchingly at him, and after a long pause he nodded\\n\\nabruptly.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd burst out into shrill protests. Flora remained unmoved.\\n\\nThen Raymond spoke.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I appreciate your motives, Miss Ackroyd. But don’t you think you’re\\n\\nbeing rather precipitate? Wait a day or two.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“To-morrow,” said Flora, in a clear voice. “It’s no good, mother, going\\n\\non like this. Whatever else I am, I’m not disloyal to my friends.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“M. Poirot,” Mrs. Ackroyd appealed tearfully, “can’t you say anything\\n\\nat all?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing to be said,” interpolated Blunt. “She’s doing the right thing.\\n\\nI’ll stand by her through thick and thin.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora held out her hand to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, Major Blunt,” she said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mademoiselle,” said Poirot, “will you let an old man congratulate you\\n\\non your courage and your loyalty? And will you not misunderstand me if\\n\\nI ask you—ask you most solemnly—to postpone the announcement you speak\\n\\nof for at least two days more?”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora hesitated.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I ask it in Ralph Paton’s interests as much as in yours, mademoiselle.\\n\\nYou frown. You do not see how that can be. But I assure you that it\\n\\nis so. _Pas de blagues_. You put the case into my hands—you must not\\n\\nhamper me now.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora paused a few minutes before replying.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I do not like it,” she said at last, “but I will do what you say.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe sat down again at the table.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And now, messieurs et mesdames,” said Poirot rapidly, “I will continue\\n\\nwith what I was about to say. Understand this, I mean to arrive at\\n\\nthe truth. The truth, however ugly in itself, is always curious and\\n\\nbeautiful to the seeker after it. I am much aged, my powers may not\\n\\nbe what they were.” Here he clearly expected a contradiction. “In all\\n\\nprobability this is the last case I shall ever investigate. But Hercule\\n\\nPoirot does not end with a failure. Messieurs et mesdames, I tell you,\\n\\nI mean to _know_. And I shall know—in spite of you all.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe brought out the last words provocatively, hurling them in our face\\n\\nas it were. I think we all flinched back a little, excepting Geoffrey\\n\\nRaymond, who remained good humored and imperturbable as usual.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How do you mean—in spite of us all?” he asked, with slightly raised\\n\\neyebrows.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But—just that, monsieur. Every one of you in this room is concealing\\n\\nsomething from me.” He raised his hand as a faint murmur of protest\\n\\narose. “Yes, yes, I know what I am saying. It may be something\\n\\nunimportant—trivial—which is supposed to have no bearing on the case,\\n\\nbut there it is. _Each one of you has something to hide._ Come, now, am\\n\\nI right?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHis glance, challenging and accusing, swept round the table. And every\\n\\npair of eyes dropped before his. Yes, mine as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am answered,” said Poirot, with a curious laugh. He got up from his\\n\\nseat. “I appeal to you all. Tell me the truth—the whole truth.” There\\n\\nwas a silence. “Will no one speak?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe gave the same short laugh again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_C’est dommage_,” he said, and went out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\n\\n                            THE GOOSE QUILL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat evening, at Poirot’s request, I went over to his house after\\n\\ndinner. Caroline saw me depart with visible reluctance. I think she\\n\\nwould have liked to have accompanied me.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot greeted me hospitably. He had placed a bottle of Irish whisky\\n\\n(which I detest) on a small table, with a soda water siphon and a\\n\\nglass. He himself was engaged in brewing hot chocolate. It was a\\n\\nfavorite beverage of his, I discovered later.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe inquired politely after my sister, whom he declared to be a most\\n\\ninteresting woman.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m afraid you’ve been giving her a swelled head,” I said dryly. “What\\n\\nabout Sunday afternoon?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe laughed and twinkled.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I always like to employ the expert,” he remarked obscurely, but he\\n\\nrefused to explain the remark.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You got all the local gossip anyway,” I remarked. “True, and untrue.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And a great deal of valuable information,” he added quietly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Such as——?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why not have told me the truth?” he countered. “In a place like this,\\n\\nall Ralph Paton’s doings were bound to be known. If your sister had not\\n\\nhappened to pass through the wood that day somebody else would have\\n\\ndone so.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I suppose they would,” I said grumpily. “What about this interest of\\n\\nyours in my patients?”\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain he twinkled.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Only one of them, doctor. Only one of them.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The last?” I hazarded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I find Miss Russell a study of the most interesting,” he said\\n\\nevasively.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you agree with my sister and Mrs. Ackroyd that there is something\\n\\nfishy about her?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Eh? What do you say—fishy?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI explained to the best of my ability.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And they say that, do they?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Didn’t my sister convey as much to you yesterday afternoon?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“_C’est possible._”\\n\\n\\n\\n“For no reason whatever,” I declared.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Les femmes_,” generalized Poirot. “They are marvelous! They invent\\n\\nhaphazard—and by miracle they are right. Not that it is that, really.\\n\\nWomen observe subconsciously a thousand little details, without knowing\\n\\nthat they are doing so. Their subconscious mind adds these little\\n\\nthings together—and they call the result intuition. Me, I am very\\n\\nskilled in psychology. I know these things.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe swelled his chest out importantly, looking so ridiculous, that I\\n\\nfound it difficult not to burst out laughing. Then he took a small sip\\n\\nof his chocolate, and carefully wiped his mustache.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wish you’d tell me,” I burst out, “what you really think of it all?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe put down his cup.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You wish that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I do.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have seen what I have seen. Should not our ideas be the same?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m afraid you’re laughing at me,” I said stiffly. “Of course, I’ve no\\n\\nexperience of matters of this kind.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot smiled at me indulgently.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are like the little child who wants to know the way the engine\\n\\nworks. You wish to see the affair, not as the family doctor sees it,\\n\\nbut with the eye of a detective who knows and cares for no one—to whom\\n\\nthey are all strangers and all equally liable to suspicion.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You put it very well,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So I give you then, a little lecture. The first thing is to get a\\n\\nclear history of what happened that evening—always bearing in mind that\\n\\nthe person who speaks may be lying.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI raised my eyebrows.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Rather a suspicious attitude.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But necessary—I assure you, necessary. Now first—Dr. Sheppard leaves\\n\\nthe house at ten minutes to nine. How do I know that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Because I told you so.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But you might not be speaking the truth—or the watch you went by might\\n\\nbe wrong. But Parker also says that you left the house at ten minutes\\n\\nto nine. So we accept that statement and pass on. At nine o’clock you\\n\\nrun into a man—and here we come to what we will call the Romance of the\\n\\nMysterious Stranger—just outside the Park gates. How do I know that\\n\\nthat is so?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I told you so,” I began again, but Poirot interrupted me with a\\n\\ngesture of impatience.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! but it is that you are a little stupid to-night, my friend. _You_\\n\\nknow that it is so—but how am _I_ to know? _Eh bien_, I am able to\\n\\ntell you that the Mysterious Stranger was not a hallucination on your\\n\\npart, because the maid of a Miss Ganett met him a few minutes before\\n\\nyou did, and of her too he inquired the way to Fernly Park. We accept\\n\\nhis presence, therefore, and we can be fairly sure of two things about\\n\\nhim—that he was a stranger to the neighborhood, and that whatever his\\n\\nobject in going to Fernly, there was no great secrecy about it, since\\n\\nhe twice asked the way there.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I said, “I see that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now I have made it my business to find out more about this man. He had\\n\\na drink at the Three Boars, I learn, and the barmaid there says that he\\n\\nspoke with an American accent and mentioned having just come over from\\n\\nthe States. Did it strike you that he had an American accent?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I think he had,” I said, after a minute or two, during which I\\n\\ncast my mind back; “but a very slight one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Précisément._ There is also this which, you will remember, I picked\\n\\nup in the summer-house?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe held out to me the little quill. I looked at it curiously. Then a\\n\\nmemory of something I had read stirred in me.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot, who had been watching my face, nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, heroin ‘snow.’ Drug-takers carry it like this, and sniff it up\\n\\nthe nose.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Diamorphine hydrochloride,” I murmured mechanically.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This method of taking the drug is very common on the other side.\\n\\nAnother proof, if we wanted one, that the man came from Canada or the\\n\\nStates.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What first attracted your attention to that summer-house?” I asked\\n\\ncuriously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My friend the inspector took it for granted that any one using that\\n\\npath did so as a short cut to the house, but as soon as I saw the\\n\\nsummer-house, I realized that the same path would be taken by any one\\n\\nusing the summer-house as a rendezvous. Now it seems fairly certain\\n\\nthat the stranger came neither to the front nor to the back door. Then\\n\\ndid some one from the house go out and meet him? If so, what could be a\\n\\nmore convenient place than that little summer-house? I searched it with\\n\\nthe hope that I might find some clew inside. I found two, the scrap of\\n\\ncambric and the quill.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And the scrap of cambric?” I asked curiously. “What about that?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot raised his eyebrows.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You do not use your little gray cells,” he remarked dryly. “The scrap\\n\\nof starched cambric should be obvious.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not very obvious to me.” I changed the subject. “Anyway,” I said,\\n\\n“this man went to the summer-house to meet somebody. Who was that\\n\\nsomebody?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Exactly the question,” said Poirot. “You will remember that Mrs.\\n\\nAckroyd and her daughter came over from Canada to live here?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is that what you meant to-day when you accused them of hiding the\\n\\ntruth?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps. Now another point. What did you think of the parlormaid’s\\n\\nstory?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What story?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The story of her dismissal. Does it take half an hour to dismiss a\\n\\nservant? Was the story of those important papers a likely one? And\\n\\nremember, though she says she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty until\\n\\nten o’clock, there is no one to confirm her statement.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You bewilder me,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“To me it grows clearer. But tell me now your own ideas and theories.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI drew a piece of paper from my pocket.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I just scribbled down a few suggestions,” I said apologetically.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But excellent—you have method. Let us hear them.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI read out in a somewhat embarrassed voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n“To begin with, one must look at the thing logically——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just what my poor Hastings used to say,” interrupted Poirot, “but\\n\\nalas! he never did so.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Point No. 1._—Mr. Ackroyd was heard talking to some one at half-past\\n\\nnine.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Point No. 2._—At some time during the evening Ralph Paton must have\\n\\ncome in through the window, as evidenced by the prints of his shoes.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Point No. 3._—Mr. Ackroyd was nervous that evening, and would only\\n\\nhave admitted some one he knew.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Point No. 4._—The person with Mr. Ackroyd at nine-thirty was asking\\n\\nfor money. We know Ralph Paton was in a scrape.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_These four points go to show that the person with Mr. Ackroyd at\\n\\nnine-thirty was Ralph Paton. But we know that Mr. Ackroyd was alive at\\n\\na quarter to ten, therefore it was not Ralph who killed him. Ralph left\\n\\nthe window open. Afterwards the murderer came in that way._”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And who was the murderer?” inquired Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The American stranger. He may have been in league with Parker, and\\n\\npossibly in Parker we have the man who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars. If\\n\\nso, Parker may have heard enough to realize the game was up, have told\\n\\nhis accomplice so, and the latter did the crime with the dagger which\\n\\nParker gave him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is a theory that,” admitted Poirot. “Decidedly you have cells of a\\n\\nkind. But it leaves a good deal unaccounted for.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Such as——?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The telephone call, the pushed-out chair——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you really think the latter important?” I interrupted.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps not,” admitted my friend. “It may have been pulled out\\n\\nby accident, and Raymond or Blunt may have shoved it into place\\n\\nunconsciously under the stress of emotion. Then there is the missing\\n\\nforty pounds.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Given by Ackroyd to Ralph,” I suggested. “He may have reconsidered his\\n\\nfirst refusal.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That still leaves one thing unexplained?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why was Blunt so certain in his own mind that it was Raymond with Mr.\\n\\nAckroyd at nine-thirty?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He explained that,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You think so? I will not press the point. Tell me instead, what were\\n\\nRalph Paton’s reasons for disappearing?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s rather more difficult,” I said slowly. “I shall have to speak\\n\\nas a medical man. Ralph’s nerves must have gone phut! If he suddenly\\n\\nfound out that his uncle had been murdered within a few minutes of his\\n\\nleaving him—after, perhaps, a rather stormy interview—well, he might\\n\\nget the wind up and clear right out. Men have been known to do that—act\\n\\nguiltily when they’re perfectly innocent.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, that is true,” said Poirot. “But we must not lose sight of one\\n\\nthing.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know what you’re going to say,” I remarked: “motive. Ralph Paton\\n\\ninherits a great fortune by his uncle’s death.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is one motive,” agreed Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Mais oui._ Do you realize that there are three separate motives\\n\\nstaring us in the face. Somebody certainly stole the blue envelope and\\n\\nits contents. That is one motive. Blackmail! Ralph Paton may have been\\n\\nthe man who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars. Remember, as far as Hammond\\n\\nknew, Ralph Paton had not applied to his uncle for help of late. That\\n\\nlooks as though he were being supplied with money elsewhere. Then there\\n\\nis the fact that he was in some—how do you say—scrape?—which he feared\\n\\nmight get to his uncle’s ears. And finally there is the one you have\\n\\njust mentioned.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dear me,” I said, rather taken aback. “The case does seem black\\n\\nagainst him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Does it?” said Poirot. “That is where we disagree, you and I. Three\\n\\nmotives—it is almost too much. I am inclined to believe that, after\\n\\nall, Ralph Paton is innocent.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\n\\n                             MRS. ACKROYD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the evening talk I have just chronicled, the affair seemed to\\n\\nme to enter on a different phase. The whole thing can be divided into\\n\\ntwo parts, each clear and distinct from the other. Part I. ranges from\\n\\nAckroyd’s death on the Friday evening to the following Monday night.\\n\\nIt is the straight-forward narrative of what occurred, as presented\\n\\nto Hercule Poirot. I was at Poirot’s elbow the whole time. I saw what\\n\\nhe saw. I tried my best to read his mind. As I know now, I failed in\\n\\nthis latter task. Though Poirot showed me all his discoveries—as, for\\n\\ninstance, the gold wedding-ring—he held back the vital and yet logical\\n\\nimpressions that he formed. As I came to know later, this secrecy was\\n\\ncharacteristic of him. He would throw out hints and suggestions, but\\n\\nbeyond that he would not go.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I say, up till the Monday evening, my narrative might have been that\\n\\nof Poirot himself. I played Watson to his Sherlock. But after Monday\\n\\nour ways diverged. Poirot was busy on his own account. I got to hear\\n\\nof what he was doing, because, in King’s Abbot, you get to hear of\\n\\neverything, but he did not take me into his confidence beforehand. And\\n\\nI, too, had my own preoccupations.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn looking back, the thing that strikes me most is the piecemeal\\n\\ncharacter of this period. Every one had a hand in the elucidation of\\n\\nthe mystery. It was rather like a jig-saw puzzle to which every one\\n\\ncontributed their own little piece of knowledge or discovery. But their\\n\\ntask ended there. To Poirot alone belongs the renown of fitting those\\n\\npieces into their correct place.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome of the incidents seemed at the time irrelevant and unmeaning.\\n\\nThere was, for instance, the question of the black boots. But that\\n\\ncomes later.... To take things strictly in chronological order, I must\\n\\nbegin with the summons from Mrs. Ackroyd.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe sent for me early on Tuesday morning, and since the summons sounded\\n\\nan urgent one, I hastened there, expecting to find her _in extremis_.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lady was in bed. So much did she concede to the etiquette of the\\n\\nsituation. She gave me her bony hand, and indicated a chair drawn up to\\n\\nthe bedside.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said, “and what’s the matter with you?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI spoke with that kind of spurious geniality which seems to be expected\\n\\nof general practitioners.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m prostrated,” said Mrs. Ackroyd in a faint voice. “Absolutely\\n\\nprostrated. It’s the shock of poor Roger’s death. They say these\\n\\nthings often aren’t felt at the _time_, you know. It’s the reaction\\n\\nafterwards.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is a pity that a doctor is precluded by his profession from being\\n\\nable sometimes to say what he really thinks.\\n\\n\\n\\nI would have given anything to be able to answer “Bunkum!”\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead, I suggested a tonic. Mrs. Ackroyd accepted the tonic. One\\n\\nmove in the game seemed now to be concluded. Not for a moment did I\\n\\nimagine that I had been sent for because of the shock occasioned by\\n\\nAckroyd’s death. But Mrs. Ackroyd is totally incapable of pursuing\\n\\na straight-forward course on any subject. She always approaches her\\n\\nobject by tortuous means. I wondered very much why it was she had sent\\n\\nfor me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And then that scene—yesterday,” continued my patient.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe paused as though expecting me to take up a cue.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What scene?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Doctor, how can you? Have you forgotten? That dreadful little\\n\\nFrenchman—or Belgian—or whatever he is. Bullying us all like he did. It\\n\\nhas quite upset me. Coming on top of Roger’s death.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m very sorry, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know what he meant—shouting at us like he did. I should hope I\\n\\nknow my duty too well to _dream_ of concealing anything. I have given\\n\\nthe police _every_ assistance in my power.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd paused, and I said, “Quite so.” I was beginning to have a\\n\\nglimmering of what all the trouble was about.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No one can say that I have failed in my duty,” continued Mrs. Ackroyd.\\n\\n“I am sure Inspector Raglan is perfectly satisfied. Why should this\\n\\nlittle upstart of a foreigner make a fuss? A most ridiculous-looking\\n\\ncreature he is too—just like a comic Frenchman in a revue. I can’t\\n\\nthink why Flora insisted on bringing him into the case. She never said\\n\\na word to me about it. Just went off and did it on her own. Flora is\\n\\ntoo independent. I am a woman of the world and her mother. She should\\n\\nhave come to me for advice first.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI listened to all this in silence.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What does he think? That’s what I want to know. Does he actually\\n\\nimagine I’m hiding something? He—he—positively _accused_ me yesterday.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is surely of no consequence, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said. “Since you are\\n\\nnot concealing anything, any remarks he may have made do not apply to\\n\\nyou.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd went off at a tangent, after her usual fashion.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Servants are so tiresome,” she said. “They gossip, and talk amongst\\n\\nthemselves. And then it gets round—and all the time there’s probably\\n\\nnothing in it at all.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Have the servants been talking?” I asked. “What about?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd cast a very shrewd glance at me. It quite threw me off my\\n\\nbalance.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I was sure _you’d_ know, doctor, if any one did. You were with M.\\n\\nPoirot all the time, weren’t you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I was.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then of course you know. It was that girl, Ursula Bourne, wasn’t it?\\n\\nNaturally—she’s leaving. She _would_ want to make all the trouble\\n\\nshe could. Spiteful, that’s what they are. They’re all alike. Now,\\n\\nyou being there, doctor, you must know exactly what she did say? I’m\\n\\nmost anxious that no wrong impression should get about. After all,\\n\\nyou don’t repeat every little detail to the police, do you? There are\\n\\nfamily matters sometimes—nothing to do with the question of the murder.\\n\\nBut if the girl was spiteful, she may have made out all sorts of\\n\\nthings.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was shrewd enough to see that a very real anxiety lay behind these\\n\\noutpourings. Poirot had been justified in his premises. Of the six\\n\\npeople round the table yesterday, Mrs. Ackroyd at least had had\\n\\nsomething to hide. It was for me to discover what that something might\\n\\nbe.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If I were you, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said brusquely, “I should make a clean\\n\\nbreast of things.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe gave a little scream.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! doctor, how can you be so abrupt. It sounds as though—as\\n\\nthough——And I can explain everything so simply.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then why not do so,” I suggested.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd took out a frilled handkerchief, and became tearful.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thought, doctor, that you might put it to M. Poirot—explain it, you\\n\\nknow—because it’s so difficult for a foreigner to see our point of\\n\\nview. And you don’t know—nobody could know—what I’ve had to contend\\n\\nwith. A martyrdom—a long martyrdom. That’s what my life has been. I\\n\\ndon’t like to speak ill of the dead—but there it is. Not the smallest\\n\\nbill, but it had all to be gone over—just as though Roger had had a\\n\\nfew miserly hundreds a year instead of being (as Mr. Hammond told me\\n\\nyesterday) one of the wealthiest men in these parts.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd paused to dab her eyes with the frilled handkerchief.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I said encouragingly. “You were talking about bills?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Those dreadful bills. And some I didn’t like to show Roger at all.\\n\\nThey were things a man wouldn’t understand. He would have said the\\n\\nthings weren’t necessary. And of course they mounted up, you know, and\\n\\nthey kept coming in——”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe looked at me appealingly, as though asking me to condole with her\\n\\non this striking peculiarity.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s a habit they have,” I agreed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And the tone altered—became quite abusive. I assure you, doctor,\\n\\nI was becoming a nervous wreck. I couldn’t sleep at nights. And a\\n\\ndreadful fluttering round the heart. And then I got a letter from a\\n\\nScotch gentleman—as a matter of fact there were two letters—both Scotch\\n\\ngentlemen. Mr. Bruce MacPherson was one, and the other were Colin\\n\\nMacDonald. Quite a coincidence.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hardly that,” I said dryly. “They are usually Scotch gentlemen, but I\\n\\nsuspect a Semitic strain in their ancestry.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ten pounds to ten thousand on note of hand alone,” murmured Mrs.\\n\\nAckroyd reminiscently. “I wrote to one of them, but it seemed there\\n\\nwere difficulties.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe paused.\\n\\n\\n\\nI gathered that we were just coming to delicate ground. I have never\\n\\nknown any one more difficult to bring to the point.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You see,” murmured Mrs. Ackroyd, “it’s all a question of expectations,\\n\\nisn’t it? Testamentary expectations. And though, of course, I expected\\n\\nthat Roger would provide for me, I didn’t _know_. I thought that if\\n\\nonly I could glance over a copy of his will—not in any sense of vulgar\\n\\nprying—but just so that I could make my own arrangements.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe glanced sideways at me. The position was now very delicate indeed.\\n\\nFortunately words, ingeniously used, will serve to mask the ugliness of\\n\\nnaked facts.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I could only tell this to you, dear Dr. Sheppard,” said Mrs. Ackroyd\\n\\nrapidly. “I can trust you not to misjudge me, and to represent the\\n\\nmatter in the right light to M. Poirot. It was on Friday afternoon——”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe came to a stop and swallowed uncertainly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I repeated encouragingly. “On Friday afternoon. Well?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Every one was out, or so I thought. And I went into Roger’s study—I\\n\\nhad some real reason for going there—I mean, there was nothing\\n\\nunderhand about it. And as I saw all the papers heaped on the desk, it\\n\\njust came to me, like a flash: ‘I wonder if Roger keeps his will in\\n\\none of the drawers of the desk.’ I’m so impulsive, always was, from a\\n\\nchild. I do things on the spur of the moment. He’d left his keys—very\\n\\ncareless of him—in the lock of the top drawer.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I see,” I said helpfully. “So you searched the desk. Did you find the\\n\\nwill?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd gave a little scream, and I realized that I had not been\\n\\nsufficiently diplomatic.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How dreadful it sounds. But it wasn’t at all like that really.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Of course it wasn’t,” I said hastily. “You must forgive my unfortunate\\n\\nway of putting things.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You see, men are so peculiar. In dear Roger’s place, I should not\\n\\nhave objected to revealing the provisions of my will. But men are so\\n\\nsecretive. One is forced to adopt little subterfuges in self-defence.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And the result of the little subterfuge?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s just what I’m telling you. As I got to the bottom drawer,\\n\\nBourne came in. Most awkward. Of course I shut the drawer and stood\\n\\nup, and I called her attention to a few specks of dust on the surface.\\n\\nBut I didn’t like the way she looked—quite respectful in manner, but a\\n\\nvery nasty light in her eyes. Almost contemptuous, if you know what I\\n\\nmean. I never have liked that girl very much. She’s a good servant, and\\n\\nshe says Ma’am, and doesn’t object to wearing caps and aprons (which\\n\\nI declare to you a lot of them do nowadays), and she can say ‘Not at\\n\\nhome’ without scruples if she has to answer the door instead of Parker,\\n\\nand she doesn’t have those peculiar gurgling noises inside which so\\n\\nmany parlormaids seem to have when they wait at table——Let me see,\\n\\nwhere was I?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You were saying, that in spite of several valuable qualities, you\\n\\nnever liked Bourne.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No more I do. She’s—odd. There’s something different about her from\\n\\nthe others. Too well educated, that’s my opinion. You can’t tell who\\n\\nare ladies and who aren’t nowadays.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And what happened next?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing. At least, Roger came in. And I thought he was out for a\\n\\nwalk. And he said: ‘What’s all this?’ and I said, ‘Nothing. I just came\\n\\nin to fetch _Punch_.’ And I took _Punch_ and went out with it. Bourne\\n\\nstayed behind. I heard her asking Roger if she could speak to him for a\\n\\nminute. I went straight up to my room, to lie down. I was very upset.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a pause.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You will explain to M. Poirot, won’t you? You can see for yourself\\n\\nwhat a trivial matter the whole thing was. But, of course, when he was\\n\\nso stern about concealing things, I thought of this at once. Bourne\\n\\nmay have made some extraordinary story out of it, but you can explain,\\n\\ncan’t you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is all?” I said. “You have told me everything?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ye-es,” said Mrs. Ackroyd. “Oh! yes,” she added firmly.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I had noted the momentary hesitation, and I knew that there was\\n\\nstill something she was keeping back. It was nothing less than a flash\\n\\nof sheer genius that prompted me to ask the question I did.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said, “was it you who left the silver table open?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI had my answer in the blush of guilt that even rouge and powder could\\n\\nnot conceal.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How did you know?” she whispered.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was you, then?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes—I—you see—there were one or two pieces of old silver—very\\n\\ninteresting. I had been reading up the subject and there was an\\n\\nillustration of quite a small piece which had fetched an immense\\n\\nsum at Christy’s. It looked to me just the same as the one in the\\n\\nsilver table. I thought I would take it up to London with me when I\\n\\nwent—and—and have it valued. Then if it really was a valuable piece,\\n\\njust think what a charming surprise it would have been for Roger?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI refrained from comments, accepting Mrs. Ackroyd’s story on its\\n\\nmerits. I even forbore to ask her why it was necessary to abstract what\\n\\nshe wanted in such a surreptitious manner.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why did you leave the lid open?” I asked. “Did you forget?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I was startled,” said Mrs. Ackroyd. “I heard footsteps coming along\\n\\nthe terrace outside. I hastened out of the room and just got up the\\n\\nstairs before Parker opened the front door to you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That must have been Miss Russell,” I said thoughtfully. Mrs. Ackroyd\\n\\nhad revealed to me one fact that was extremely interesting. Whether her\\n\\ndesigns upon Ackroyd’s silver had been strictly honorable I neither\\n\\nknew nor cared. What did interest me was the fact that Miss Russell\\n\\nmust have entered the drawing-room by the window, and that I had not\\n\\nbeen wrong when I judged her to be out of breath with running. Where\\n\\nhad she been? I thought of the summer-house and the scrap of cambric.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wonder if Miss Russell has her handkerchiefs starched!” I exclaimed\\n\\non the spur of the moment.\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd’s start recalled me to myself, and I rose.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You think you can explain to M. Poirot?” she asked anxiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, certainly. Absolutely.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI got away at last, after being forced to listen to more justifications\\n\\nof her conduct.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe parlormaid was in the hall, and it was she who helped me on with my\\n\\novercoat. I observed her more closely than I had done heretofore. It\\n\\nwas clear that she had been crying.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How is it,” I asked, “that you told us that Mr. Ackroyd sent for you\\n\\non Friday to his study? I hear now that it was _you_ who asked to speak\\n\\nto _him_?”\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a minute the girl’s eyes dropped before mine.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen she spoke.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I meant to leave in any case,” she said uncertainly.\\n\\n\\n\\nI said no more. She opened the front door for me. Just as I was passing\\n\\nout, she said suddenly in a low voice:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Excuse me, sir, is there any news of Captain Paton?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI shook my head, looking at her inquiringly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He ought to come back,” she said. “Indeed—indeed he ought to come\\n\\nback.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was looking at me with appealing eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Does no one know where he is?” she asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you?” I said sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe shook her head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, indeed. I know nothing. But any one who was a friend to him would\\n\\ntell him this: he ought to come back.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI lingered, thinking that perhaps the girl would say more. Her next\\n\\nquestion surprised me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When do they think the murder was done? Just before ten o’clock?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is the idea,” I said. “Between a quarter to ten and the hour.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not earlier? Not before a quarter to ten?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI looked at her attentively. She was so clearly eager for a reply in\\n\\nthe affirmative.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s out of the question,” I said. “Miss Ackroyd saw her uncle alive\\n\\nat a quarter to ten.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe turned away, and her whole figure seemed to droop.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A handsome girl,” I said to myself as I drove off. “An exceedingly\\n\\nhandsome girl.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline was at home. She had had a visit from Poirot and was very\\n\\npleased and important about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am helping him with the case,” she explained.\\n\\n\\n\\nI felt rather uneasy. Caroline is bad enough as it is. What will she be\\n\\nlike with her detective instincts encouraged?\\n\\n\\n\\n“Are you going round the neighborhood looking for Ralph Paton’s\\n\\nmysterious girl?” I inquired.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I might do that on my own account,” said Caroline. “No, this is a\\n\\nspecial thing M. Poirot wants me to find out for him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is it?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He wants to know whether Ralph Paton’s boots were black or brown,”\\n\\nsaid Caroline with tremendous solemnity.\\n\\n\\n\\nI stared at her. I see now that I was unbelievably stupid about these\\n\\nboots. I failed altogether to grasp the point.\\n\\n\\n\\n“They were brown shoes,” I said. “I saw them.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not shoes, James, boots. M. Poirot wants to know whether a pair of\\n\\nboots Ralph had with him at the hotel were brown or black. A lot hangs\\n\\non it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCall me dense if you like. I didn’t see.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And how are you going to find out?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline said there would be no difficulty about that. Our Annie’s\\n\\ndearest friend was Miss Ganett’s maid, Clara. And Clara was walking\\n\\nout with the boots at the Three Boars. The whole thing was simplicity\\n\\nitself, and by the aid of Miss Ganett, who coöperated loyally, at once\\n\\ngiving Clara leave of absence, the matter was rushed through at express\\n\\nspeed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was when we were sitting down to lunch that Caroline remarked, with\\n\\nwould-be unconcern:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“About those boots of Ralph Paton’s.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” I said, “what about them?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“M. Poirot thought they were probably brown. He was wrong. They’re\\n\\nblack.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Caroline nodded her head several times. She evidently felt that she\\n\\nhad scored a point over Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\nI did not answer. I was puzzling over what the color of a pair of Ralph\\n\\nPaton’s boots had to do with the case.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\n\\n                           GEOFFREY RAYMOND\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI was to have a further proof that day of the success of Poirot’s\\n\\ntactics. That challenge of his had been a subtle touch born of his\\n\\nknowledge of human nature. A mixture of fear and guilt had wrung the\\n\\ntruth from Mrs. Ackroyd. She was the first to react.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat afternoon when I returned from seeing my patients, Caroline told\\n\\nme that Geoffrey Raymond had just left.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did he want to see me?” I asked, as I hung up my coat in the hall.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline was hovering by my elbow.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was M. Poirot he wanted to see,” she said. “He’d just come from The\\n\\nLarches. M. Poirot was out. Mr. Raymond thought that he might be here,\\n\\nor that you might know where he was.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I haven’t the least idea.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I tried to make him wait,” said Caroline, “but he said he would call\\n\\nback at The Larches in half an hour, and went away down the village. A\\n\\ngreat pity, because M. Poirot came in practically the minute after he\\n\\nleft.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Came in here?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, to his own house.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How do you know?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The side window,” said Caroline briefly.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt seemed to me that we had now exhausted the topic. Caroline thought\\n\\notherwise.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Aren’t you going across?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Across where?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“To The Larches, of course.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear Caroline,” I said, “what for?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Raymond wanted to see him very particularly,” said Caroline. “You\\n\\nmight hear what it’s all about.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI raised my eyebrows.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Curiosity is not my besetting sin,” I remarked coldly. “I can exist\\n\\ncomfortably without knowing exactly what my neighbors are doing and\\n\\nthinking.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Stuff and nonsense, James,” said my sister. “You want to know just\\n\\nas much as I do. You’re not so honest, that’s all. You always have to\\n\\npretend.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Really, Caroline,” I said, and retired into my surgery.\\n\\n\\n\\nTen minutes later Caroline tapped at the door and entered. In her hand\\n\\nshe held what seemed to be a pot of jam.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wonder, James,” she said, “if you would mind taking this pot of\\n\\nmedlar jelly across to M. Poirot? I promised it to him. He has never\\n\\ntasted any home-made medlar jelly.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why can’t Annie go?” I asked coldly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“She’s doing some mending. I can’t spare her.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline and I looked at each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very well,” I said, rising. “But if I take the beastly thing, I shall\\n\\njust leave it at the door. You understand that?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy sister raised her eyebrows.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Naturally,” she said. “Who suggested you should do anything else?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe honors were with Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you _do_ happen to see M. Poirot,” she said, as I opened the front\\n\\ndoor, “you might tell him about the boots.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a most subtle parting shot. I wanted dreadfully to understand\\n\\nthe enigma of the boots. When the old lady with the Breton cap opened\\n\\nthe door to me, I found myself asking if M. Poirot was in, quite\\n\\nautomatically.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot sprang up to meet me, with every appearance of pleasure.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sit down, my good friend,” he said. “The big chair? This small one?\\n\\nThe room is not too hot, no?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI thought it was stifling, but refrained from saying so. The windows\\n\\nwere closed, and a large fire burned in the grate.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The English people, they have a mania for the fresh air,” declared\\n\\nPoirot. “The big air, it is all very well outside, where it belongs.\\n\\nWhy admit it to the house? But let us not discuss such banalities. You\\n\\nhave something for me, yes?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Two things,” I said. “First—this—from my sister.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI handed over the pot of medlar jelly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How kind of Mademoiselle Caroline. She has remembered her promise. And\\n\\nthe second thing?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Information—of a kind.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I told him of my interview with Mrs. Ackroyd. He listened with\\n\\ninterest, but not much excitement.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It clears the ground,” he said thoughtfully. “And it has a certain\\n\\nvalue as confirming the evidence of the housekeeper. She said, you\\n\\nremember, that she found the silver table lid open and closed it down\\n\\nin passing.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What about her statement that she went into the drawing-room to see if\\n\\nthe flowers were fresh?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! we never took that very seriously, did we, my friend? It was\\n\\npatently an excuse, trumped up in a hurry, by a woman who felt it\\n\\nurgent to explain her presence—which, by the way, you would probably\\n\\nnever have thought of questioning. I considered it possible that her\\n\\nagitation might arise from the fact that she had been tampering with\\n\\nthe silver table, but I think now that we must look for another cause.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I said. “Whom did she go out to meet? And why?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You think she went to meet some one?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I do.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So do I,” he said thoughtfully.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a pause.\\n\\n\\n\\n“By the way,” I said, “I’ve got a message for you from my sister. Ralph\\n\\nPaton’s boots were black, not brown.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was watching him closely as I gave the message, and I fancied that\\n\\nI saw a momentary flicker of discomposure. If so, it passed almost\\n\\nimmediately.\\n\\n\\n\\n“She is absolutely positive they are not brown?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Absolutely.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” said Poirot regretfully. “That is a pity.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd he seemed quite crestfallen.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe entered into no explanations, but at once started a new subject of\\n\\nconversation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The housekeeper, Miss Russell, who came to consult you on that Friday\\n\\nmorning—is it indiscreet to ask what passed at the interview—apart from\\n\\nthe medical details, I mean?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not at all,” I said. “When the professional part of the conversation\\n\\nwas over, we talked for a few minutes about poisons, and the ease or\\n\\ndifficulty of detecting them, and about drug-taking and drug-takers.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“With special reference to cocaine?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How did you know?” I asked, somewhat surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor answer, the little man rose and crossed the room to where\\n\\nnewspapers were filed. He brought me a copy of the _Daily Budget_,\\n\\ndated Friday, 16th September, and showed me an article dealing with the\\n\\nsmuggling of cocaine. It was a somewhat lurid article, written with an\\n\\neye to picturesque effect.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is what put cocaine into her head, my friend,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nI would have catechized him further, for I did not quite understand his\\n\\nmeaning, but at that moment the door opened and Geoffrey Raymond was\\n\\nannounced.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe came in fresh and debonair as ever, and greeted us both.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How are you, doctor? M. Poirot, this is the second time I’ve been here\\n\\nthis morning. I was anxious to catch you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps I’d better be off,” I suggested rather awkwardly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not on my account, doctor. No, it’s just this,” he went on, seating\\n\\nhimself at a wave of invitation from Poirot, “I’ve got a confession to\\n\\nmake.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“_En verité_?” said Poirot, with an air of polite interest.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, it’s of no consequence, really. But, as a matter of fact, my\\n\\nconscience has been pricking me ever since yesterday afternoon. You\\n\\naccused us all of keeping back something, M. Poirot. I plead guilty.\\n\\nI’ve had something up my sleeve.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And what is that, M. Raymond?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“As I say, it’s nothing of consequence—just this. I was in debt—badly,\\n\\nand that legacy came in the nick of time. Five hundred pounds puts me\\n\\non my feet again with a little to spare.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe smiled at us both with that engaging frankness that made him such a\\n\\nlikable youngster.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You know how it is. Suspicious looking policeman—don’t like to admit\\n\\nyou were hard up for money—think it will look bad to them. But I was\\n\\na fool, really, because Blunt and I were in the billiard room from a\\n\\nquarter to ten onwards, so I’ve got a watertight alibi and nothing to\\n\\nfear. Still, when you thundered out that stuff about concealing things,\\n\\nI felt a nasty prick of conscience, and I thought I’d like to get it\\n\\noff my mind.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe got up again and stood smiling at us.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are a very wise young man,” said Poirot, nodding at him with\\n\\napproval. “See you, when I know that any one is hiding things from me,\\n\\nI suspect that the thing hidden may be something very bad indeed. You\\n\\nhave done well.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m glad I’m cleared from suspicion,” laughed Raymond. “I’ll be off\\n\\nnow.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“So that is that,” I remarked, as the door closed behind the young\\n\\nsecretary.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” agreed Poirot. “A mere bagatelle—but if he had not been in the\\n\\nbilliard room—who knows? After all, many crimes have been committed for\\n\\nthe sake of less than five hundred pounds. It all depends on what sum\\n\\nis sufficient to break a man. A question of the relativity, is it not\\n\\nso? Have you reflected, my friend, that many people in that house stood\\n\\nto benefit by Mr. Ackroyd’s death? Mrs. Ackroyd, Miss Flora, young Mr.\\n\\nRaymond, the housekeeper, Miss Russell. Only one, in fact, does not,\\n\\nMajor Blunt.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHis tone in uttering that name was so peculiar that I looked up,\\n\\npuzzled.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t quite understand you?” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Two of the people I accused have given me the truth.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You think Major Blunt has something to conceal also?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“As for that,” remarked Poirot nonchalantly, “there is a saying, is\\n\\nthere not, that Englishmen conceal only one thing—their love? And Major\\n\\nBlunt, I should say, is not good at concealments.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sometimes,” I said, “I wonder if we haven’t rather jumped to\\n\\nconclusions on one point.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’ve assumed that the blackmailer of Mrs. Ferrars is necessarily the\\n\\nmurderer of Mr. Ackroyd. Mightn’t we be mistaken?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded energetically.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very good. Very good indeed. I wondered if that idea would come to\\n\\nyou. Of course it is possible. But we must remember one point. The\\n\\nletter disappeared. Still, that, as you say, may not necessarily mean\\n\\nthat the murderer took it. When you first found the body, Parker may\\n\\nhave abstracted the letter unnoticed by you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Parker?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, Parker. I always come back to Parker—not as the murderer—no, he\\n\\ndid not commit the murder; but who is more suitable than he as the\\n\\nmysterious scoundrel who terrorized Mrs. Ferrars? He may have got his\\n\\ninformation about Mr. Ferrars’s death from one of the King’s Paddock\\n\\nservants. At any rate, he is more likely to have come upon it than a\\n\\ncasual guest such as Blunt, for instance.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Parker might have taken the letter,” I admitted. “It wasn’t till later\\n\\nthat I noticed it was gone.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How much later? After Blunt and Raymond were in the room, or before?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can’t remember,” I said slowly. “I think it was before—no,\\n\\nafterwards. Yes, I’m almost sure it was afterwards.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That widens the field to three,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “But Parker\\n\\nis the most likely. It is in my mind to try a little experiment with\\n\\nParker. How say you, my friend, will you accompany me to Fernly?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI acquiesced, and we set out at once. Poirot asked to see Miss Ackroyd,\\n\\nand presently Flora came to us.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Flora,” said Poirot, “I have to confide in you a little\\n\\nsecret. I am not yet satisfied of the innocence of Parker. I propose to\\n\\nmake a little experiment with your assistance. I want to reconstruct\\n\\nsome of his actions on that night. But we must think of something to\\n\\ntell him—ah! I have it. I wish to satisfy myself as to whether voices\\n\\nin the little lobby could have been heard outside on the terrace. Now,\\n\\nring for Parker, if you will be so good.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI did so, and presently the butler appeared, suave as ever.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You rang, sir?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, my good Parker. I have in mind a little experiment. I have placed\\n\\nMajor Blunt on the terrace outside the study window. I want to see if\\n\\nany one there could have heard the voices of Miss Ackroyd and yourself\\n\\nin the lobby that night. I want to enact that little scene over again.\\n\\nPerhaps you would fetch the tray or whatever it was you were carrying?”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker vanished, and we repaired to the lobby outside the study door.\\n\\nPresently we heard a chink in the outer hall, and Parker appeared in\\n\\nthe doorway carrying a tray with a siphon, a decanter of whisky, and\\n\\ntwo glasses on it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One moment,” cried Poirot, raising his hand and seemingly very\\n\\nexcited. “We must have everything in order. Just as it occurred. It is\\n\\na little method of mine.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A foreign custom, sir,” said Parker. “Reconstruction of the crime they\\n\\ncall it, do they not?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was quite imperturbable as he stood there politely waiting on\\n\\nPoirot’s orders.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! he knows something, the good Parker,” cried Poirot. “He has read\\n\\nof these things. Now, I beg you, let us have everything of the most\\n\\nexact. You came from the outer hall—so. Mademoiselle was—where?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Here,” said Flora, taking up her stand just outside the study door.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite right, sir,” said Parker.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I had just closed the door,” continued Flora.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, miss,” agreed Parker. “Your hand was still on the handle as it is\\n\\nnow.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then _allez_,” said Poirot. “Play me the little comedy.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora stood with her hand on the door handle, and Parker came stepping\\n\\nthrough the door from the hall, bearing the tray.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stopped just inside the door. Flora spoke.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! Parker. Mr. Ackroyd doesn’t want to be disturbed again to-night.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is that right?” she added in an undertone.\\n\\n\\n\\n“To the best of my recollection, Miss Flora,” said Parker, “but I fancy\\n\\nyou used the word evening instead of night.” Then, raising his voice\\n\\nin a somewhat theatrical fashion: “Very good, miss. Shall I lock up as\\n\\nusual?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, please.”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker retired through the door, Flora followed him, and started to\\n\\nascend the main staircase.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is that enough?” she asked over her shoulder.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Admirable,” declared the little man, rubbing his hands. “By the way,\\n\\nParker, are you sure there were two glasses on the tray that evening?\\n\\nWho was the second one for?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I always bring two glasses, sir,” said Parker. “Is there anything\\n\\nfurther?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing. I thank you.”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker withdrew, dignified to the last.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot stood in the middle of the hall frowning. Flora came down and\\n\\njoined us.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Has your experiment been successful?” she asked. “I don’t quite\\n\\nunderstand, you know——”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot smiled admiringly at her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is not necessary that you should,” he said. “But tell me, were\\n\\nthere indeed two glasses on Parker’s tray that night?”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora wrinkled her brows a minute.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I really can’t remember,” she said. “I think there were. Is—is that\\n\\nthe object of your experiment?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot took her hand and patted it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Put it this way,” he said. “I am always interested to see if people\\n\\nwill speak the truth.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And did Parker speak the truth?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I rather think he did,” said Poirot thoughtfully.\\n\\n\\n\\nA few minutes later saw us retracing our steps to the village.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What was the point of that question about the glasses?” I asked\\n\\ncuriously.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One must say something,” he remarked. “That particular question did as\\n\\nwell as any other.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI stared at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“At any rate, my friend,” he said more seriously, “I know now something\\n\\nI wanted to know. Let us leave it at that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\n\\n                        AN EVENING AT MAH JONG\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat night we had a little Mah Jong party. This kind of simple\\n\\nentertainment is very popular in King’s Abbot. The guests arrive in\\n\\ngoloshes and waterproofs after dinner. They partake of coffee and later\\n\\nof cake, sandwiches, and tea.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn this particular night our guests were Miss Ganett and Colonel\\n\\nCarter, who lives near the church. A good deal of gossip is handed\\n\\nround at these evenings, sometimes seriously interfering with the\\n\\ngame in progress. We used to play bridge—chatty bridge of the worst\\n\\ndescription. We find Mah Jong much more peaceful. The irritated demand\\n\\nas to why on earth your partner did not lead a certain card is entirely\\n\\ndone away with, and though we still express criticisms frankly, there\\n\\nis not the same acrimonious spirit.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very cold evening, eh, Sheppard?” said Colonel Carter, standing with\\n\\nhis back to the fire. Caroline had taken Miss Ganett to her own room,\\n\\nand was there assisting her to disentangle herself from her many wraps.\\n\\n“Reminds me of the Afghan passes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Indeed?” I said politely.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very mysterious business this about poor Ackroyd,” continued the\\n\\ncolonel, accepting a cup of coffee. “A deuce of a lot behind it—that’s\\n\\nwhat I say. Between you and me, Sheppard, I’ve heard the word blackmail\\n\\nmentioned!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe colonel gave me the look which might be tabulated “one man of the\\n\\nworld to another.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A woman in it, no doubt,” he said. “Depend upon it, a woman in it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline and Miss Ganett joined us at this minute. Miss Ganett drank\\n\\ncoffee whilst Caroline got out the Mah Jong box and poured out the\\n\\ntiles upon the table.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Washing the tiles,” said the colonel facetiously. “That’s\\n\\nright—washing the tiles, as we used to say in the Shanghai Club.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is the private opinion of both Caroline and myself that Colonel\\n\\nCarter has never been in the Shanghai Club in his life. More, that he\\n\\nhas never been farther east than India, where he juggled with tins of\\n\\nbully beef and plum and apple jam during the Great War. But the colonel\\n\\nis determinedly military, and in King’s Abbot we permit people to\\n\\nindulge their little idiosyncrasies freely.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Shall we begin?” said Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe sat round the table. For some five minutes there was complete\\n\\nsilence, owing to the fact that there is tremendous secret competition\\n\\namongst us as to who can build their wall quickest.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Go on, James,” said Caroline at last. “You’re East Wind.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI discarded a tile. A round or two proceeded, broken by the monotonous\\n\\nremarks of “Three Bamboos,” “Two Circles,” “Pung,” and frequently\\n\\nfrom Miss Ganett “Unpung,” owing to that lady’s habit of too hastily\\n\\nclaiming tiles to which she had no right.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I saw Flora Ackroyd this morning,” said Miss Ganett. “Pung—no—Unpung.\\n\\nI made a mistake.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Four Circles,” said Caroline. “Where did you see her?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She didn’t see _me_,” said Miss Ganett, with that tremendous\\n\\nsignificance only to be met with in small villages.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” said Caroline interestedly. “Chow.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I believe,” said Miss Ganett, temporarily diverted, “that it’s the\\n\\nright thing nowadays to say ‘Chee’ not ‘Chow.’”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense,” said Caroline. “I have always said ‘_Chow_.’”\\n\\n\\n\\n“In the Shanghai Club,” said Colonel Carter, “they say ‘_Chow_.’”\\n\\n\\n\\nMiss Ganett retired, crushed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What were you saying about Flora Ackroyd?” asked Caroline, after a\\n\\nmoment or two devoted to the game. “Was she with any one?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very much so,” said Miss Ganett.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe eyes of the two ladies met, and seemed to exchange information.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Really,” said Caroline interestedly. “Is that it? Well, it doesn’t\\n\\nsurprise me in the least.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’re waiting for you to discard, Miss Caroline,” said the colonel. He\\n\\nsometimes affects the pose of the bluff male, intent on the game and\\n\\nindifferent to gossip. But nobody is deceived.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you ask me,” said Miss Ganett. (“Was that a Bamboo you discarded,\\n\\ndear? Oh! no, I see now—it was a Circle.) As I was saying, if you ask\\n\\nme, Flora’s been exceedingly lucky. Exceedingly lucky she’s been.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How’s that, Miss Ganett?” asked the colonel. “I’ll Pung that Green\\n\\nDragon. How do you make out that Miss Flora’s been lucky? Very charming\\n\\ngirl and all that, I know.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I mayn’t know very much about crime,” said Miss Ganett, with the air\\n\\nof one who knows everything there is to know, “but I can tell you one\\n\\nthing. The first question that’s always asked is ‘Who last saw the\\n\\ndeceased alive?’ And the person who did is regarded with suspicion.\\n\\nNow, Flora Ackroyd last saw her uncle alive. It might have looked very\\n\\nnasty for her—very nasty indeed. It’s my opinion—and I give it for what\\n\\nit’s worth, that Ralph Paton is staying away on her account, to draw\\n\\nsuspicion away from her.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Come, now,” I protested mildly, “you surely can’t suggest that a young\\n\\ngirl like Flora Ackroyd is capable of stabbing her uncle in cold blood?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, I don’t know,” said Miss Ganett. “I’ve just been reading a book\\n\\nfrom the library about the underworld of Paris, and it says that some\\n\\nof the worst women criminals are young girls with the faces of angels.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s in France,” said Caroline instantly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just so,” said the colonel. “Now, I’ll tell you a very curious thing—a\\n\\nstory that was going round the Bazaars in India....”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe colonel’s story was one of interminable length, and of curiously\\n\\nlittle interest. A thing that happened in India many years ago cannot\\n\\ncompare for a moment with an event that took place in King’s Abbot the\\n\\nday before yesterday.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was Caroline who brought the colonel’s story to a close by\\n\\nfortunately going Mah Jong. After the slight unpleasantness always\\n\\noccasioned by my corrections of Caroline’s somewhat faulty arithmetic,\\n\\nwe started a new hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“East Wind passes,” said Caroline. “I’ve got an idea of my own about\\n\\nRalph Paton. Three Characters. But I’m keeping it to myself for the\\n\\npresent.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Are you, dear?” said Miss Ganett. “Chow—I mean Pung.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” said Caroline firmly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Was it all right about the boots?” asked Miss Ganett. “Their being\\n\\nblack, I mean?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite all right,” said Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What was the point, do you think?” asked Miss Ganett.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline pursed up her lips, and shook her head with an air of knowing\\n\\nall about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pung,” said Miss Ganett. “No—Unpung. I suppose that now the doctor’s\\n\\nin with M. Poirot he knows all the secrets?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Far from it,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“James is so modest,” said Caroline. “Ah! a concealed Kong.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe colonel gave vent to a whistle. For the moment gossip was\\n\\nforgotten.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your own wind, too,” he said. “_And_ you’ve got two Pungs of Dragons.\\n\\nWe must be careful. Miss Caroline’s out for a big hand.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe played for some minutes with no irrelevant conversation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This M. Poirot now,” said Colonel Carter, “is he really such a great\\n\\ndetective?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The greatest the world has ever known,” said Caroline solemnly. “He\\n\\nhad to come here incognito to avoid publicity.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Chow,” said Miss Ganett. “Quite wonderful for our little village, I’m\\n\\nsure. By the way, Clara—my maid, you know—is great friends with Elsie,\\n\\nthe housemaid at Fernly, and what do you think Elsie told her? That\\n\\nthere’s been a lot of money stolen, and it’s her opinion—Elsie’s—I\\n\\nmean, that the parlormaid had something to do with it. She’s leaving\\n\\nat the month, and she’s crying a good deal at night. If you ask me,\\n\\nthe girl is very likely in league with a _gang_. She’s always been a\\n\\nqueer girl—she’s not friends with any of the girls round here. She\\n\\ngoes off by herself on her days out—very unnatural, I call it, and\\n\\nmost suspicious. I asked her once to come to our Girls’ Friendly\\n\\nEvenings, but she refused, and then I asked her a few questions about\\n\\nher home and her family—all that sort of thing, and I’m bound to say I\\n\\nconsidered her manner most impertinent. Outwardly very respectful—but\\n\\nshe shut me up in the most barefaced way.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMiss Ganett stopped for breath, and the colonel, who was totally\\n\\nuninterested in the servant question, remarked that in the Shanghai\\n\\nClub brisk play was the invariable rule.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had a round of brisk play.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That Miss Russell,” said Caroline. “She came here pretending to\\n\\nconsult James on Friday morning. It’s my opinion she wanted to see\\n\\nwhere the poisons were kept. Five Characters.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Chow,” said Miss Ganett. “What an extraordinary idea? I wonder if you\\n\\ncan be right.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Talking of poisons,” said the colonel. “Eh—what? Haven’t I discarded?\\n\\nOh! Eight Bamboos.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mah Jong!” said Miss Ganett.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline was very much annoyed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One Red Dragon,” she said regretfully, “and I should have had a hand\\n\\nof three doubles.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve had two Red Dragons all the time,” I mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So exactly like you, James,” said Caroline reproachfully. “You’ve no\\n\\nconception of the spirit of the game.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI myself thought I had played rather cleverly. I should have had to pay\\n\\nCaroline an enormous amount if she had gone Mah Jong. Miss Ganett’s Mah\\n\\nJong was of the poorest variety possible, as Caroline did not fail to\\n\\npoint out to her.\\n\\n\\n\\nEast Wind passed, and we started a new hand in silence.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What I was going to tell you just now was this,” said Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes?” said Miss Ganett encouragingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My idea about Ralph Paton, I mean.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, dear,” said Miss Ganett, still more encouragingly. “Chow!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s a sign of weakness to Chow so early,” said Caroline severely.\\n\\n“You should go for a big hand.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know,” said Miss Ganett. “You were saying—about Ralph Paton, you\\n\\nknow?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes. Well, I’ve a pretty shrewd idea where he is.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe all stopped to stare at her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This is very interesting, Miss Caroline,” said Colonel Carter. “All\\n\\nyour own idea, eh?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, not exactly. I’ll tell you about it. You know that big map of\\n\\nthe county we have in the hall?”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe all said Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As M. Poirot was going out the other day, he stopped and looked at it,\\n\\nand he made some remark—I can’t remember exactly what it was. Something\\n\\nabout Cranchester being the only big town anywhere near us—which is\\n\\ntrue, of course. But after he had gone—it came to me suddenly.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What came to you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“His meaning. Of course Ralph is in Cranchester.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was at that moment that I knocked down the rack that held my pieces.\\n\\nMy sister immediately reproved me for clumsiness, but half-heartedly.\\n\\nShe was intent on her theory.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Cranchester, Miss Caroline?” said Colonel Carter. “Surely not\\n\\nCranchester! It’s so near.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s exactly it,” cried Caroline triumphantly. “It seems quite clear\\n\\nby now that he didn’t get away from here by train. He must simply have\\n\\nwalked into Cranchester. And I believe he’s there still. No one would\\n\\ndream of his being so near at hand.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI pointed out several objections to the theory, but when once Caroline\\n\\nhas got something firmly into her head, nothing dislodges it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And you think M. Poirot has the same idea,” said Miss Ganett\\n\\nthoughtfully. “It’s a curious coincidence, but I was out for a walk\\n\\nthis afternoon on the Cranchester road, and he passed me in a car\\n\\ncoming from that direction.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe all looked at each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why, dear me,” said Miss Ganett suddenly, “I’m Mah Jong all the time,\\n\\nand I never noticed it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline’s attention was distracted from her own inventive exercises.\\n\\nShe pointed out to Miss Ganett that a hand consisting of mixed suits\\n\\nand too many Chows was hardly worth going Mah Jong on. Miss Ganett\\n\\nlistened imperturbably and collected her counters.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, dear, I know what you mean,” she said. “But it rather depends on\\n\\nwhat kind of a hand you have to start with, doesn’t it?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’ll never get the big hands if you don’t go for them,” urged\\n\\nCaroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, we must all play our own way, mustn’t we?” said Miss Ganett. She\\n\\nlooked down at her counters. “After all, I’m up, so far.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline, who was considerably down, said nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\nEast Wind passed, and we set to once more. Annie brought in the tea\\n\\nthings. Caroline and Miss Ganett were both slightly ruffled as is\\n\\noften the case during one of these festive evenings.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you would only play a leetle quicker, dear,” said Caroline, as Miss\\n\\nGanett hesitated over her discard. “The Chinese put down the tiles so\\n\\nquickly it sounds like little birds pattering.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFor some few minutes we played like the Chinese.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You haven’t contributed much to the sum of information, Sheppard,”\\n\\nsaid Colonel Carter genially. “You’re a sly dog. Hand in glove with the\\n\\ngreat detective, and not a hint as to the way things are going.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“James is an extraordinary creature,” said Caroline. “He can _not_\\n\\nbring himself to part with information.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe looked at me with some disfavor.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I assure you,” I said, “that I don’t know anything. Poirot keeps his\\n\\nown counsel.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Wise man,” said the colonel with a chuckle. “He doesn’t give himself\\n\\naway. But they’re wonderful fellows, these foreign detectives. Up to\\n\\nall sorts of dodges, I believe.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pung,” said Miss Ganett, in a tone of quiet triumph. “And Mah Jong.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe situation became more strained. It was annoyance at Miss Ganett’s\\n\\ngoing Mah Jong for the third time running which prompted Caroline to\\n\\nsay to me as we built a fresh wall:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are too tiresome, James. You sit there like a dead head, and say\\n\\nnothing at all!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But, my dear,” I protested, “I have really nothing to say—that is, of\\n\\nthe kind you mean.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense,” said Caroline, as she sorted her hand. “You _must_ know\\n\\nsomething interesting.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI did not answer for a moment. I was overwhelmed and intoxicated. I had\\n\\nread of there being such a thing as the Perfect Winning—going Mah Jong\\n\\non one’s original hand. I had never hoped to hold the hand myself.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith suppressed triumph I laid my hand face upwards on the table.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As they say in the Shanghai Club,” I remarked, “Tin-ho—the Perfect\\n\\nWinning!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe colonel’s eyes nearly bulged out of his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Upon my soul,” he said. “What an extraordinary thing. I never saw that\\n\\nhappen before!”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was then that I went on, goaded by Caroline’s gibes, and rendered\\n\\nreckless by my triumph.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And as to anything interesting,” I said. “What about a gold wedding\\n\\nring with a date and ‘From R.’ inside.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI pass over the scene that followed. I was made to say exactly where\\n\\nthis treasure was found. I was made to reveal the date.\\n\\n\\n\\n“March 13th,” said Caroline. “Just six months ago. Ah!”\\n\\n\\n\\nOut of the babel of excited suggestions and suppositions three theories\\n\\nwere evolved:—\\n\\n\\n\\n1. That of Colonel Carter: that Ralph was secretly married to Flora.\\n\\nThe first or most simple solution.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. That of Miss Ganett: that Roger Ackroyd had been secretly married to\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars.\\n\\n\\n\\n3. That of my sister: that Roger Ackroyd had married his housekeeper,\\n\\nMiss Russell.\\n\\n\\n\\nA fourth or super-theory was propounded by Caroline later as we went up\\n\\nto bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mark my words,” she said suddenly, “I shouldn’t be at all surprised if\\n\\nGeoffrey Raymond and Flora weren’t married.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Surely it would be ‘From G,’ not ‘From R’ then,” I suggested.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You never know. Some girls call men by their surnames. And you heard\\n\\nwhat Miss Ganett said this evening—about Flora’s carryings on.”\\n\\n\\n\\nStrictly speaking, I had not heard Miss Ganett say anything of the\\n\\nkind, but I respected Caroline’s knowledge of innuendoes.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How about Hector Blunt,” I hinted. “If it’s anybody——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense,” said Caroline. “I dare say he admires her—may even be in\\n\\nlove with her. But depend upon it a girl isn’t going to fall in love\\n\\nwith a man old enough to be her father when there’s a good-looking\\n\\nyoung secretary about. She may encourage Major Blunt just as a blind.\\n\\nGirls are very artful. But there’s one thing I _do_ tell you, James\\n\\nSheppard. Flora Ackroyd does not care a penny piece for Ralph Paton,\\n\\nand never has. You can take it from me.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI took it from her meekly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\n\\n                                PARKER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt occurred to me the next morning that under the exhilaration\\n\\nproduced by Tin-ho, or the Perfect Winning, I might have been slightly\\n\\nindiscreet. True, Poirot had not asked me to keep the discovery of\\n\\nthe ring to myself. On the other hand, he had said nothing about it\\n\\nwhilst at Fernly, and as far as I knew, I was the only person aware\\n\\nthat it had been found. I felt distinctly guilty. The fact was by now\\n\\nspreading through King’s Abbot like wildfire. I was expecting wholesale\\n\\nreproaches from Poirot any minute.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe joint funeral of Mrs. Ferrars and Roger Ackroyd was fixed for\\n\\neleven o’clock. It was a melancholy and impressive ceremony. All the\\n\\nparty from Fernly were there.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter it was over, Poirot, who had also been present, took me by the\\n\\narm, and invited me to accompany him back to The Larches. He was\\n\\nlooking very grave, and I feared that my indiscretion of the night\\n\\nbefore had got round to his ears. But it soon transpired that his\\n\\nthoughts were occupied by something of a totally different nature.\\n\\n\\n\\n“See you,” he said. “We must act. With your help I propose to examine a\\n\\nwitness. We will question him, we will put such fear into him that the\\n\\ntruth is bound to come out.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What witness are you talking of?” I asked, very much surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Parker!” said Poirot. “I asked him to be at my house this morning at\\n\\ntwelve o’clock. He should await us there at this very minute.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What do you think,” I ventured, glancing sideways at his face.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know this—that I am not satisfied.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You think that it was he who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Either that, or——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well?” I said, after waiting a minute or two.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My friend, I will say this to you—I hope it was he.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gravity of his manner, and something indefinable that tinged it,\\n\\nreduced me to silence.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn arrival at The Larches, we were informed that Parker was already\\n\\nthere awaiting our return. As we entered the room, the butler rose\\n\\nrespectfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good morning, Parker,” said Poirot pleasantly. “One instant, I pray of\\n\\nyou.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe removed his overcoat and gloves.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Allow me, sir,” said Parker, and sprang forward to assist him. He\\n\\ndeposited the articles neatly on a chair by the door. Poirot watched\\n\\nhim with approval.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Thank you, my good Parker,” he said. “Take a seat, will you not? What\\n\\nI have to say may take some time.”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker seated himself with an apologetic bend of the head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now what do you think I asked you to come here for this morning—eh?”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker coughed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I understood, sir, that you wished to ask me a few questions about my\\n\\nlate master—private like.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Précisément_,” said Poirot, beaming. “Have you made many experiments\\n\\nin blackmail?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sir!”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe butler sprang to his feet.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do not excite yourself,” said Poirot placidly. “Do not play the farce\\n\\nof the honest, injured man. You know all there is to know about the\\n\\nblackmail, is it not so?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Sir, I—I’ve never—never been——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Insulted,” suggested Poirot, “in such a way before. Then why, my\\n\\nexcellent Parker, were you so anxious to overhear the conversation in\\n\\nMr. Ackroyd’s study the other evening, after you had caught the word\\n\\nblackmail?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I wasn’t—I——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who was your last master?” rapped out Poirot suddenly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My last master?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, the master you were with before you came to Mr. Ackroyd.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A Major Ellerby, sir——”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot took the words out of his mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Just so, Major Ellerby. Major Ellerby was addicted to drugs, was he\\n\\nnot? You traveled about with him. When he was in Bermuda there was some\\n\\ntrouble—a man was killed. Major Ellerby was partly responsible. It was\\n\\nhushed up. But you knew about it. How much did Major Ellerby pay you to\\n\\nkeep your mouth shut?”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker was staring at him open-mouthed. The man had gone to pieces, his\\n\\ncheeks shook flabbily.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You see, me, I have made inquiries,” said Poirot pleasantly. “It is\\n\\nas I say. You got a good sum then as blackmail, and Major Ellerby went\\n\\non paying you until he died. Now I want to hear about your latest\\n\\nexperiment.”\\n\\n\\n\\nParker still stared.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is useless to deny. Hercule Poirot _knows_. It is so, what I have\\n\\nsaid about Major Ellerby, is it not?”\\n\\n\\n\\nAs though against his will, Parker nodded reluctantly once. His face\\n\\nwas ashen pale.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But I never hurt a hair of Mr. Ackroyd’s head,” he moaned. “Honest to\\n\\nGod, sir, I didn’t. I’ve been afraid of this coming all the time. And I\\n\\ntell you I didn’t—I didn’t kill him.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHis voice rose almost to a scream.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I am inclined to believe you, my friend,” said Poirot. “You have not\\n\\nthe nerve—the courage. But I must have the truth.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll tell you anything, sir, anything you want to know. It’s true that\\n\\nI tried to listen that night. A word or two I heard made me curious.\\n\\nAnd Mr. Ackroyd’s wanting not to be disturbed, and shutting himself up\\n\\nwith the doctor the way he did. It’s God’s own truth what I told the\\n\\npolice. I heard the word blackmail, sir, and well——”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe paused.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You thought there might be something in it for you?” suggested Poirot\\n\\nsmoothly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well—well, yes, I did, sir. I thought that if Mr. Ackroyd was being\\n\\nblackmailed, why shouldn’t I have a share of the pickings?”\\n\\n\\n\\nA very curious expression passed over Poirot’s face. He leaned forward.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Had you any reason to suppose before that night that Mr. Ackroyd was\\n\\nbeing blackmailed?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, indeed, sir. It was a great surprise to me. Such a regular\\n\\ngentleman in all his habits.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How much did you overhear?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not very much, sir. There seemed what I might call a spite against me.\\n\\nOf course I had to attend to my duties in the pantry. And when I did\\n\\ncreep along once or twice to the study it was no use. The first time\\n\\nDr. Sheppard came out and almost caught me in the act, and another time\\n\\nMr. Raymond passed me in the big hall and went that way, so I knew it\\n\\nwas no use; and when I went with the tray, Miss Flora headed me off.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot stared for a long time at the man, as if to test his sincerity.\\n\\nParker returned his gaze earnestly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I hope you believe me, sir. I’ve been afraid all along the police\\n\\nwould rake up that old business with Major Ellerby and be suspicious of\\n\\nme in consequence.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Eh bien_,” said Poirot at last. “I am disposed to believe you. But\\n\\nthere is one thing I must request of you—to show me your bank-book. You\\n\\nhave a bank-book, I presume?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir, as a matter of fact, I have it with me now.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWith no sign of confusion, he produced it from his pocket. Poirot took\\n\\nthe slim, green-covered book and perused the entries.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! I perceive you have purchased £500 of National Savings\\n\\nCertificates this year?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, sir. I have already over a thousand pounds saved—the result of\\n\\nmy connection with—er—my late master, Major Ellerby. And I have had\\n\\nquite a little flutter on some horses this year—very successful. If you\\n\\nremember, sir, a rank outsider won the Jubilee. I was fortunate enough\\n\\nto back it—£20.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot handed him back the book.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will wish you good-morning. I believe that you have told me the\\n\\ntruth. If you have not—so much the worse for you, my friend.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Parker had departed, Poirot picked up his overcoat once more.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Going out again?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, we will pay a little visit to the good M. Hammond.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You believe Parker’s story?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is credible enough on the face of it. It seems clear that—unless\\n\\nhe is a very good actor indeed—he genuinely believes it was Ackroyd\\n\\nhimself who was the victim of blackmail. If so, he knows nothing at all\\n\\nabout the Mrs. Ferrars business.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then in that case—who——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Précisément!_ Who? But our visit to M. Hammond will accomplish one\\n\\npurpose. It will either clear Parker completely or else——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I fall into the bad habit of leaving my sentences unfinished this\\n\\nmorning,” said Poirot apologetically. “You must bear with me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“By the way,” I said, rather sheepishly, “I’ve got a confession to\\n\\nmake. I’m afraid I have inadvertently let out something about that\\n\\nring.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What ring?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The ring you found in the goldfish pond.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! yes,” said Poirot, smiling broadly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I hope you’re not annoyed? It was very careless of me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But not at all, my good friend, not at all. I laid no commands upon\\n\\nyou. You were at liberty to speak of it if you so wished. She was\\n\\ninterested, your sister?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“She was indeed. It created a sensation. All sorts of theories are\\n\\nflying about.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! And yet it is so simple. The true explanation leapt to the eye,\\n\\ndid it not?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did it?” I said dryly.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot laughed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The wise man does not commit himself,” he observed. “Is not that so?\\n\\nBut here we are at Mr. Hammond’s.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lawyer was in his office, and we were ushered in without any delay.\\n\\nHe rose and greeted us in his dry, precise manner.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot came at once to the point.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Monsieur, I desire from you certain information, that is, if you will\\n\\nbe so good as to give it to me. You acted, I understand, for the late\\n\\nMrs. Ferrars of King’s Paddock?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI noticed the swift gleam of surprise which showed in the lawyer’s\\n\\neyes, before his professional reserve came down once more like a mask\\n\\nover his face.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly. All her affairs passed through our hands.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very good. Now, before I ask you to tell me anything, I should like\\n\\nyou to listen to the story Dr. Sheppard will relate to you. You have no\\n\\nobjection, have you, my friend, to repeating the conversation you had\\n\\nwith Mr. Ackroyd last Friday night?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not in the least,” I said, and straightway began the recital of that\\n\\nstrange evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nHammond listened with close attention.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is all,” I said, when I had finished.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Blackmail,” said the lawyer thoughtfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are surprised?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lawyer took off his pince-nez and polished them with his\\n\\nhandkerchief.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” he replied, “I can hardly say that I am surprised. I have\\n\\nsuspected something of the kind for some time.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That brings us,” said Poirot, “to the information for which I am\\n\\nasking. If any one can give us an idea of the actual sums paid, you are\\n\\nthe man, monsieur.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I see no object in withholding the information,” said Hammond, after\\n\\na moment or two. “During the past year, Mrs. Ferrars has sold out\\n\\ncertain securities, and the money for them was paid into her account\\n\\nand not reinvested. As her income was a large one, and she lived very\\n\\nquietly after her husband’s death, it seems certain that these sums of\\n\\nmoney were paid away for some special purpose. I once sounded her on\\n\\nthe subject, and she said that she was obliged to support several of\\n\\nher husband’s poor relations. I let the matter drop, of course. Until\\n\\nnow, I have always imagined that the money was paid to some woman who\\n\\nhad had a claim on Ashley Ferrars. I never dreamed that Mrs. Ferrars\\n\\nherself was involved.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And the amount?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In all, I should say the various sums totaled at least twenty thousand\\n\\npounds.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Twenty thousand pounds!” I exclaimed. “In one year!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. Ferrars was a very wealthy woman,” said Poirot dryly. “And the\\n\\npenalty for murder is not a pleasant one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is there anything else that I can tell you?” inquired Mr. Hammond.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thank you, no,” said Poirot, rising. “All my excuses for having\\n\\nderanged you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not at all, not at all.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The word derange,” I remarked, when we were outside again, “is\\n\\napplicable to mental disorder only.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” cried Poirot, “never will my English be quite perfect. A curious\\n\\nlanguage. I should then have said disarranged, _n’est-ce pas_?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Disturbed is the word you had in mind.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thank you, my friend. The word exact, you are zealous for it. _Eh\\n\\nbien_, what about our friend Parker now? With twenty thousand pounds\\n\\nin hand, would he have continued being a butler? _Je ne pense pas._ It\\n\\nis, of course, possible that he banked the money under another name,\\n\\nbut I am disposed to believe he spoke the truth to us. If he is a\\n\\nscoundrel, he is a scoundrel on a mean scale. He has not the big ideas.\\n\\nThat leaves us as a possibility, Raymond, or—well—Major Blunt.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Surely not Raymond,” I objected. “Since we know that he was\\n\\ndesperately hard up for a matter of five hundred pounds.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is what he says, yes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And as to Hector Blunt——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will tell you something as to the good Major Blunt,” interrupted\\n\\nPoirot. “It is my business to make inquiries. I make them. _Eh\\n\\nbien_—that legacy of which he speaks, I have discovered that the amount\\n\\nof it was close upon twenty thousand pounds. What do you think of that?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was so taken aback that I could hardly speak.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s impossible,” I said at last. “A well-known man like Hector Blunt.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who knows? At least he is a man with big ideas. I confess that I\\n\\nhardly see him as a blackmailer, but there is another possibility that\\n\\nyou have not even considered.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The fire, my friend. Ackroyd himself may have destroyed that letter,\\n\\nblue envelope and all, after you left him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I hardly think that likely,” I said slowly. “And yet—of course, it\\n\\nmay be so. He might have changed his mind.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had just arrived at my house, and on the spur of the moment I\\n\\ninvited Poirot to come in and take pot luck.\\n\\n\\n\\nI thought Caroline would be pleased with me, but it is hard to satisfy\\n\\none’s women folk. It appears that we were eating chops for lunch—the\\n\\nkitchen staff being regaled on tripe and onions. And two chops set\\n\\nbefore three people are productive of embarrassment.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Caroline is seldom daunted for long. With magnificent mendacity,\\n\\nshe explained to Poirot that although James laughed at her for\\n\\ndoing so, she adhered strictly to a vegetarian diet. She descanted\\n\\necstatically on the delights of nut cutlets (which I am quite sure\\n\\nshe has never tasted) and ate a Welsh rarebit with gusto and frequent\\n\\ncutting remarks as to the dangers of “flesh” foods.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfterwards, when we were sitting in front of the fire and smoking,\\n\\nCaroline attacked Poirot directly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not found Ralph Paton yet?” she asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where should I find him, mademoiselle?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thought, perhaps, you’d found him in Cranchester,” said Caroline,\\n\\nwith intense meaning in her tone.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot looked merely bewildered.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In Cranchester? But why in Cranchester?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI enlightened him with a touch of malice.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One of our ample staff of private detectives happened to see you in a\\n\\ncar on the Cranchester road yesterday,” I explained.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot’s bewilderment vanished. He laughed heartily.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah, that! A simple visit to the dentist, _c’est tout_. My tooth, it\\n\\naches. I go there. My tooth, it is at once better. I think to return\\n\\nquickly. The dentist, he says No. Better to have it out. I argue. He\\n\\ninsists. He has his way! That particular tooth, it will never ache\\n\\nagain.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline collapsed rather like a pricked balloon.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe fell to discussing Ralph Paton.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A weak nature,” I insisted. “But not a vicious one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” said Poirot. “But weakness, where does it end?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Exactly,” said Caroline. “Take James here—weak as water, if I weren’t\\n\\nabout to look after him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear Caroline,” I said irritably, “can’t you talk without dragging\\n\\nin personalities?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You _are_ weak, James,” said Caroline, quite unmoved. “I’m eight years\\n\\nolder than you are—oh! I don’t mind M. Poirot knowing that——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I should never have guessed it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot, with a\\n\\ngallant little bow.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Eight years older. But I’ve always considered it my duty to look after\\n\\nyou. With a bad bringing up, Heaven knows what mischief you might have\\n\\ngot into by now.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I might have married a beautiful adventuress,” I murmured, gazing at\\n\\nthe ceiling, and blowing smoke rings.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Adventuress!” said Caroline, with a snort. “If we’re talking of\\n\\nadventuresses——”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe left the sentence unfinished.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well?” I said, with some curiosity.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing. But I can think of some one not a hundred miles away.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThen she turned to Poirot suddenly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“James sticks to it that you believe some one in the house committed\\n\\nthe murder. All I can say is, you’re wrong.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I should not like to be wrong,” said Poirot. “It is not—how do you\\n\\nsay—my _métier_?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve got the facts pretty clearly,” continued Caroline, taking no\\n\\nnotice of Poirot’s remark, “from James and others. As far as I can see,\\n\\nof the people in the house, only two _could_ have had the chance of\\n\\ndoing it. Ralph Paton and Flora Ackroyd.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear Caroline——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, James, don’t interrupt me. I know what I’m talking about. Parker\\n\\nmet her _outside_ the door, didn’t he? He didn’t hear her uncle saying\\n\\ngood-night to her. She could have killed him then and there.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Caroline.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m not saying she _did_, James. I’m saying she _could_ have done. As\\n\\na matter of fact, though Flora is like all these young girls nowadays,\\n\\nwith no veneration for their betters and thinking they know best on\\n\\nevery subject under the sun, I don’t for a minute believe she’d kill\\n\\neven a chicken. But there it is. Mr. Raymond and Major Blunt have\\n\\nalibis. Mrs. Ackroyd’s got an alibi. Even that Russell woman seems to\\n\\nhave one—and a good job for her it is she has. Who is left? Only Ralph\\n\\nand Flora! And say what you will, I don’t believe Ralph Paton is a\\n\\nmurderer. A boy we’ve known all our lives.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot was silent for a minute, watching the curling smoke rise from\\n\\nhis cigarette. When at last he spoke, it was in a gentle far-away voice\\n\\nthat produced a curious impression. It was totally unlike his usual\\n\\nmanner.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Let us take a man—a very ordinary man. A man with no idea of murder\\n\\nin his heart. There is in him somewhere a strain of weakness—deep\\n\\ndown. It has so far never been called into play. Perhaps it never will\\n\\nbe—and if so he will go to his grave honored and respected by every\\n\\none. But let us suppose that something occurs. He is in difficulties—or\\n\\nperhaps not that even. He may stumble by accident on a secret—a secret\\n\\ninvolving life or death to some one. And his first impulse will be to\\n\\nspeak out—to do his duty as an honest citizen. And then the strain of\\n\\nweakness tells. Here is a chance of money—a great amount of money.\\n\\nHe wants money—he desires it—and it is so easy. He has to do nothing\\n\\nfor it—just keep silence. That is the beginning. The desire for money\\n\\ngrows. He must have more—and more! He is intoxicated by the gold mine\\n\\nwhich has opened at his feet. He becomes greedy. And in his greed he\\n\\noverreaches himself. One can press a man as far as one likes—but with\\n\\na woman one must not press too far. For a woman has at heart a great\\n\\ndesire to speak the truth. How many husbands who have deceived their\\n\\nwives go comfortably to their graves, carrying their secret with them!\\n\\nHow many wives who have deceived their husbands wreck their lives by\\n\\nthrowing the fact in those same husbands’ teeth! They have been pressed\\n\\ntoo far. In a reckless moment (which they will afterwards regret, _bien\\n\\nentendu_) they fling safety to the winds and turn at bay, proclaiming\\n\\nthe truth with great momentary satisfaction to themselves. So it was, I\\n\\nthink, in this case. The strain was too great. And so there came your\\n\\nproverb, the death of the goose that laid the golden eggs. But that is\\n\\nnot the end. Exposure faced the man of whom we are speaking. And he is\\n\\nnot the same man he was—say, a year ago. His moral fiber is blunted.\\n\\nHe is desperate. He is fighting a losing battle, and he is prepared to\\n\\ntake any means that come to his hand, for exposure means ruin to him.\\n\\nAnd so—the dagger strikes!”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was silent for a moment. It was as though he had laid a spell upon\\n\\nthe room. I cannot try to describe the impression his words produced.\\n\\nThere was something in the merciless analysis, and the ruthless power\\n\\nof vision which struck fear into both of us.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Afterwards,” he went on softly, “the danger removed, he will be\\n\\nhimself again, normal, kindly. But if the need again arises, then once\\n\\nmore he will strike.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline roused herself at last.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are speaking of Ralph Paton,” she said. “You may be right, you may\\n\\nnot, but you have no business to condemn a man unheard.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe telephone bell rang sharply. I went out into the hall, and took off\\n\\nthe receiver.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What?” I said. “Yes. Dr. Sheppard speaking.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI listened for a minute or two, then replied briefly. Replacing the\\n\\nreceiver, I went back into the drawing-room.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Poirot,” I said, “they have detained a man at Liverpool. His name is\\n\\nCharles Kent, and he is believed to be the stranger who visited Fernly\\n\\nthat night. They want me to go to Liverpool at once and identify him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHARLES KENT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHalf an hour later saw Poirot, myself, and Inspector Raglan in the\\n\\ntrain on the way to Liverpool. The inspector was clearly very excited.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We may get a line on the blackmailing part of the business, if on\\n\\nnothing else,” he declared jubilantly. “He’s a rough customer, this\\n\\nfellow, by what I heard over the phone. Takes dope, too. We ought to\\n\\nfind it easy to get what we want out of him. If there was the shadow of\\n\\na motive, nothing’s more likely than that he killed Mr. Ackroyd. But in\\n\\nthat case, why is young Paton keeping out of the way? The whole thing’s\\n\\na muddle—that’s what it is. By the way, M. Poirot, you were quite right\\n\\nabout those fingerprints. They were Mr. Ackroyd’s own. I had rather the\\n\\nsame idea myself, but I dismissed it as hardly feasible.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI smiled to myself. Inspector Raglan was so very plainly saving his\\n\\nface.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As regards this man,” said Poirot, “he is not yet arrested, eh?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, detained under suspicion.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And what account does he give of himself?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Precious little,” said the inspector, with a grin. “He’s a wary bird,\\n\\nI gather. A lot of abuse, but very little more.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOn arrival at Liverpool I was surprised to find that Poirot was\\n\\nwelcomed with acclamation. Superintendent Hayes, who met us, had worked\\n\\nwith Poirot over some case long ago, and had evidently an exaggerated\\n\\nopinion of his powers.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now we’ve got M. Poirot here we shan’t be long,” he said cheerfully.\\n\\n“I thought you’d retired, moosior?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“So I had, my good Hayes, so I had. But how tedious is retirement! You\\n\\ncannot imagine to yourself the monotony with which day comes after day.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very likely. So you’ve come to have a look at our own particular find?\\n\\nIs this Dr. Sheppard? Think you’ll be able to identify him, sir?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m not very sure,” I said doubtfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How did you get hold of him?” inquired Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Description was circulated, as you know. In the press and privately.\\n\\nNot much to go on, I admit. This fellow has an American accent all\\n\\nright, and he doesn’t deny that he was near King’s Abbot that night.\\n\\nJust asks what the hell it is to do with us, and that he’ll see us in\\n\\n—— before he answers any questions.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is it permitted that I, too, see him?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe superintendent closed one eye knowingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very glad to have you, sir. You’ve got permission to do anything you\\n\\nplease. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard was asking after you the other\\n\\nday. Said he’d heard you were connected unofficially with this case.\\n\\nWhere’s Captain Paton hiding, sir, can you tell me that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I doubt if it would be wise at the present juncture,” said Poirot\\n\\nprimly, and I bit my lips to prevent a smile.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe little man really did it very well.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter some further parley, we were taken to interview the prisoner.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was a young fellow, I should say not more than twenty-two or\\n\\nthree. Tall, thin, with slightly shaking hands, and the evidences of\\n\\nconsiderable physical strength somewhat run to seed. His hair was dark,\\n\\nbut his eyes were blue and shifty, seldom meeting a glance squarely. I\\n\\nhad all along cherished the illusion that there was something familiar\\n\\nabout the figure I had met that night, but if this were indeed he, I\\n\\nwas completely mistaken. He did not remind me in the least of any one I\\n\\nknew.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now then, Kent,” said the superintendent, “stand up. Here are some\\n\\nvisitors come to see you. Recognize any of them.”\\n\\n\\n\\nKent glared at us sullenly, but did not reply. I saw his glance waver\\n\\nover the three of us, and come back to rest on me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, sir,” said the superintendent to me, “what do you say?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The height’s the same,” I said, “and as far as general appearance goes\\n\\nit might well be the man in question. Beyond that, I couldn’t go.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What the hell’s the meaning of all this?” asked Kent. “What have you\\n\\ngot against me? Come on, out with it! What am I supposed to have done?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI nodded my head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s the man,” I said. “I recognize the voice.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Recognize my voice, do you? Where do you think you heard it before?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“On Friday evening last, outside the gates of Fernly Park. You asked me\\n\\nthe way there.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I did, did I?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you admit it?” asked the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t admit anything. Not till I know what you’ve got on me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Have you not read the papers in the last few days?” asked Poirot,\\n\\nspeaking for the first time.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man’s eyes narrowed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So that’s it, is it? I saw an old gent had been croaked at Fernly.\\n\\nTrying to make out I did the job, are you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You were there that night,” said Poirot quietly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“How do you know, mister?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“By this.” Poirot took something from his pocket and held it out.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was the goose quill we had found in the summer-house.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the sight of it the man’s face changed. He half held out his hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Snow,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “No, my friend, it is empty. It lay\\n\\nwhere you dropped it in the summer-house that night.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCharles Kent looked at him uncertainly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You seem to know a hell of a lot about everything, you little foreign\\n\\ncock duck. Perhaps you remember this: the papers say that the old gent\\n\\nwas croaked between a quarter to ten and ten o’clock?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is so,” agreed Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, but is it really so? That’s what I’m getting at.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“This gentleman will tell you,” said Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe indicated Inspector Raglan. The latter hesitated, glanced at\\n\\nSuperintendent Hayes, then at Poirot, and finally, as though receiving\\n\\nsanction, he said:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s right. Between a quarter to ten and ten o’clock.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then you’ve nothing to keep me here for,” said Kent. “I was away from\\n\\nFernly Park by twenty-five minutes past nine. You can ask at the Dog\\n\\nand Whistle. That’s a saloon about a mile out of Fernly on the road to\\n\\nCranchester. I kicked up a bit of a row there, I remember. As near as\\n\\nnothing to quarter to ten, it was. How about that?”\\n\\n\\n\\nInspector Raglan wrote down something in his notebook.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well?” demanded Kent.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Inquiries will be made,” said the inspector. “If you’ve spoken the\\n\\ntruth, you won’t have anything to complain about. What were you doing\\n\\nat Fernly Park anyway?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Went there to meet some one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s none of your business.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’d better keep a civil tongue in your head, my man,” the\\n\\nsuperintendent warned him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“To hell with a civil tongue. I went there on my own business, and\\n\\nthat’s all there is to it. If I was clear away before the murder was\\n\\ndone, that’s all that concerns the cops.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your name, it is Charles Kent,” said Poirot. “Where were you born?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man stared at him, then he grinned.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m a full-blown Britisher all right,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” said Poirot meditatively, “I think you are. I fancy you were\\n\\nborn in Kent.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man stared.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why’s that? Because of my name? What’s that to do with it? Is a man\\n\\nwhose name is Kent bound to be born in that particular county?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Under certain circumstances, I can imagine he might be,” said Poirot\\n\\nvery deliberately. “Under certain circumstances, you comprehend.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was so much meaning in his voice as to surprise the two police\\n\\nofficers. As for Charles Kent, he flushed a brick red, and for a moment\\n\\nI thought he was going to spring at Poirot. He thought better of it,\\n\\nhowever, and turned away with a kind of laugh.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded as though satisfied, and made his way out through the\\n\\ndoor. He was joined presently by the two officers.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We’ll verify that statement,” remarked Raglan. “I don’t think he’s\\n\\nlying, though. But he’s got to come clear with a statement as to\\n\\nwhat he was doing at Fernly. It looks to me as though we’d got our\\n\\nblackmailer all right. On the other hand, granted his story’s correct,\\n\\nhe couldn’t have had anything to do with the actual murder. He’d got\\n\\nten pounds on him when he was arrested—rather a large sum. I fancy that\\n\\nforty pounds went to him—the numbers of the notes didn’t correspond,\\n\\nbut of course he’d have changed them first thing. Mr. Ackroyd must\\n\\nhave given him the money, and he made off with it as fast as possible.\\n\\nWhat was that about Kent being his birthplace? What’s that got to do\\n\\nwith it?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nothing whatever,” said Poirot mildly. “A little idea of mine, that\\n\\nwas all. Me, I am famous for my little ideas.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Are you really?” said Raglan, studying him with a puzzled expression.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe superintendent went into a roar of laughter.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Many’s the time I’ve heard Inspector Japp say that. M. Poirot and his\\n\\nlittle ideas! Too fanciful for me, he’d say, but always something in\\n\\nthem.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You mock yourself at me,” said Poirot, smiling; “but never mind. The\\n\\nold ones they laugh last sometimes, when the young, clever ones do not\\n\\nlaugh at all.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd nodding his head at them in a sage manner, he walked out into the\\n\\nstreet.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe and I lunched together at an hotel. I know now that the whole thing\\n\\nlay clearly unravelled before him. He had got the last thread he needed\\n\\nto lead him to the truth.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut at the time I had no suspicion of the fact. I overestimated his\\n\\ngeneral self-confidence, and I took it for granted that the things\\n\\nwhich puzzled me must be equally puzzling to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy chief puzzle was what the man Charles Kent could have been doing at\\n\\nFernly. Again and again I put the question to myself and could get no\\n\\nsatisfactory reply.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt last I ventured a tentative query to Poirot. His reply was immediate.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Mon ami_, I do not think; I know.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Really?” I said incredulously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, indeed. I suppose now that to you it would not make sense if I\\n\\nsaid that he went to Fernly that night because he was born in Kent?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI stared at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It certainly doesn’t seem to make sense to me,” I said dryly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah!” said Poirot pityingly. “Well, no matter. I have still my little\\n\\nidea.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\n\\n                             FLORA ACKROYD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I was returning from my round the following morning, I was hailed by\\n\\nInspector Raglan. I pulled up, and the inspector mounted on the step.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good-morning, Dr. Sheppard,” he said. “Well, that alibi is all right\\n\\nenough.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Charles Kent’s?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Charles Kent’s. The barmaid at the Dog and Whistle, Sally Jones, she\\n\\nremembers him perfectly. Picked out his photograph from among five\\n\\nothers. It was just a quarter to ten when he came into the bar, and the\\n\\nDog and Whistle is well over a mile from Fernly Park. The girl mentions\\n\\nthat he had a lot of money on him—she saw him take a handful of notes\\n\\nout of his pocket. Rather surprised her, it did, seeing the class of\\n\\nfellow he was, with a pair of boots clean dropping off him. That’s\\n\\nwhere that forty pounds went right enough.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The man still refuses to give an account of his visit to Fernly?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Obstinate as a mule he is. I had a chat with Hayes at Liverpool over\\n\\nthe wire this morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Hercule Poirot says he knows the reason the man went there that\\n\\nnight,” I observed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Does he?” cried the inspector eagerly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I said maliciously. “He says he went there because he was born\\n\\nin Kent.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI felt a distinct pleasure in passing on my own discomfiture.\\n\\n\\n\\nRaglan stared at me for a moment or two uncomprehendingly. Then a\\n\\ngrin overspread his weaselly countenance and he tapped his forehead\\n\\nsignificantly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Bit gone here,” he said. “I’ve thought so for some time. Poor old\\n\\nchap, so that’s why he had to give up and come down here. In the\\n\\nfamily, very likely. He’s got a nephew who’s quite off his crumpet.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Poirot has?” I said, very surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes. Hasn’t he ever mentioned him to you? Quite docile, I believe, and\\n\\nall that, but mad as a hatter, poor lad.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who told you that?”\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain a grin showed itself on Inspector Raglan’s face.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Your sister, Miss Sheppard, she told me all about it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nReally, Caroline is amazing. She never rests until she knows the last\\n\\ndetails of everybody’s family secrets. Unfortunately, I have never been\\n\\nable to instill into her the decency of keeping them to herself.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Jump in, inspector,” I said, opening the door of the car. “We’ll go\\n\\nup to The Larches together, and acquaint our Belgian friend with the\\n\\nlatest news.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Might as well, I suppose. After all, even if he is a bit balmy, it was\\n\\na useful tip he gave me about those fingerprints. He’s got a bee in his\\n\\nbonnet about the man Kent, but who knows—there may be something useful\\n\\nbehind it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot received us with his usual smiling courtesy.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe listened to the information we had brought him, nodding his head now\\n\\nand then.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Seems quite O.K., doesn’t it?” said the inspector rather gloomily. “A\\n\\nchap can’t be murdering some one in one place when he’s drinking in the\\n\\nbar in another place a mile away.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Are you going to release him?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t see what else we can do. We can’t very well hold him for\\n\\nobtaining money on false pretences. Can’t prove a ruddy thing.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector tossed a match into the grate in a disgruntled fashion.\\n\\nPoirot retrieved it and put it neatly in a little receptacle designed\\n\\nfor the purpose. His action was purely mechanical. I could see that his\\n\\nthoughts were on something very different.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If I were you,” he said at last, “I should not release the man Charles\\n\\nKent yet.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n\\n\\nRaglan stared at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What I say. I should not release him yet.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don’t think he can have had anything to do with the murder, do\\n\\nyou?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think probably not—but one cannot be certain yet.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But haven’t I just told you——”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot raised a hand protestingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Mais oui, mais oui._ I heard. I am not deaf—nor stupid, thank the\\n\\ngood God! But see you, you approach the matter from the wrong—the\\n\\nwrong—premises, is not that the word?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector stared at him heavily.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t see how you make that out. Look here, we know Mr. Ackroyd was\\n\\nalive at a quarter to ten. You admit that, don’t you?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot looked at him for a moment, then shook his head with a quick\\n\\nsmile.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I admit nothing that is not—_proved_!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, we’ve got proof enough of that. We’ve got Miss Flora Ackroyd’s\\n\\nevidence.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That she said good-night to her uncle? But me—I do not always believe\\n\\nwhat a young lady tells me—no, not even when she is charming and\\n\\nbeautiful.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But hang it all, man, Parker saw her coming out of the door.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No.” Poirot’s voice rang out with sudden sharpness. “That is just what\\n\\nhe did not see. I satisfied myself of that by a little experiment the\\n\\nother day—you remember, doctor? Parker saw her _outside_ the door, with\\n\\nher hand on the handle. He did not see her come out of the room.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But—where else could she have been?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps on the stairs.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The stairs?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is my little idea—yes.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But those stairs only lead to Mr. Ackroyd’s bedroom.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Precisely.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd still the inspector stared.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You think she’d been up to her uncle’s bedroom? Well, why not? Why\\n\\nshould she lie about it?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! that is just the question. It depends on what she was doing there,\\n\\ndoes it not?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You mean—the money? Hang it all, you don’t suggest that it was Miss\\n\\nAckroyd who took that forty pounds?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I suggest nothing,” said Poirot. “But I will remind you of this. Life\\n\\nwas not very easy for that mother and daughter. There were bills—there\\n\\nwas constant trouble over small sums of money. Roger Ackroyd was a\\n\\npeculiar man over money matters. The girl might be at her wit’s end for\\n\\na comparatively small sum. Figure to yourself then what happens. She\\n\\nhas taken the money, she descends the little staircase. When she is\\n\\nhalf-way down she hears the chink of glass from the hall. She has not a\\n\\ndoubt of what it is—Parker coming to the study. At all costs she must\\n\\nnot be found on the stairs—Parker will not forget it, he will think it\\n\\nodd. If the money is missed, Parker is sure to remember having seen her\\n\\ncome down those stairs. She has just time to rush down to the study\\n\\ndoor—with her hand on the handle to show that she has just come out,\\n\\nwhen Parker appears in the doorway. She says the first thing that comes\\n\\ninto her head, a repetition of Roger Ackroyd’s orders earlier in the\\n\\nevening, and then goes upstairs to her own room.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, but later,” persisted the inspector, “she must have realized the\\n\\nvital importance of speaking the truth? Why, the whole case hinges on\\n\\nit!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Afterwards,” said Poirot dryly, “it was a little difficult for\\n\\nMademoiselle Flora. She is told simply that the police are here and\\n\\nthat there has been a robbery. Naturally she jumps to the conclusion\\n\\nthat the theft of the money has been discovered. Her one idea is to\\n\\nstick to her story. When she learns that her uncle is dead she is\\n\\npanic-stricken. Young women do not faint nowadays, monsieur, without\\n\\nconsiderable provocation. _Eh bien!_ there it is. She is bound to stick\\n\\nto her story, or else confess everything. And a young and pretty girl\\n\\ndoes not like to admit that she is a thief—especially before those\\n\\nwhose esteem she is anxious to retain.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRaglan brought his fist down with a thump on the table.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ll not believe it,” he said. “It’s—it’s not credible. And you—you’ve\\n\\nknown this all along?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The possibility has been in my mind from the first,” admitted Poirot.\\n\\n“I was always convinced that Mademoiselle Flora was hiding something\\n\\nfrom us. To satisfy myself, I made the little experiment I told you of.\\n\\nDr. Sheppard accompanied me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A test for Parker, you said it was,” I remarked bitterly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Mon ami_,” said Poirot apologetically, “as I told you at the time,\\n\\none must say something.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector rose.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There’s only one thing for it,” he declared. “We must tackle the young\\n\\nlady right away. You’ll come up to Fernly with me, M. Poirot?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly. Dr. Sheppard will drive us up in his car.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI acquiesced willingly.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn inquiry for Miss Ackroyd, we were shown into the billiard room.\\n\\nFlora and Major Hector Blunt were sitting on the long window seat.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good-morning, Miss Ackroyd,” said the inspector. “Can we have a word\\n\\nor two alone with you?”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt got up at once and moved to the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is it?” asked Flora nervously. “Don’t go, Major Blunt. He can\\n\\nstay, can’t he?” she asked, turning to the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s as you like,” said the inspector dryly. “There’s a question\\n\\nor two it’s my duty to put to you, miss, but I’d prefer to do so\\n\\nprivately, and I dare say you’d prefer it also.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora looked keenly at him. I saw her face grow whiter. Then she turned\\n\\nand spoke to Blunt.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I want you to stay—please—yes, I mean it. Whatever the inspector has\\n\\nto say to me, I’d rather you heard it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRaglan shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, if you will have it so, that’s all there is to it. Now, Miss\\n\\nAckroyd, M. Poirot here has made a certain suggestion to me. He\\n\\nsuggests that you weren’t in the study at all last Friday night, that\\n\\nyou never saw Mr. Ackroyd to say good-night to him, that instead of\\n\\nbeing in the study you were on the stairs leading down from your\\n\\nuncle’s bedroom when you heard Parker coming across the hall.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlora’s gaze shifted to Poirot. He nodded back at her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mademoiselle, the other day, when we sat round the table, I implored\\n\\nyou to be frank with me. What one does not tell to Papa Poirot he finds\\n\\nout. It was that, was it not? See, I will make it easy for you. You\\n\\ntook the money, did you not?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The money,” said Blunt sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a silence which lasted for at least a minute.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen Flora drew herself up and spoke.\\n\\n\\n\\n“M. Poirot is right. I took that money. I stole. I am a thief—yes, a\\n\\ncommon, vulgar little thief. Now you know! I am glad it has come out.\\n\\nIt’s been a nightmare, these last few days!” She sat down suddenly and\\n\\nburied her face in her hands. She spoke huskily through her fingers.\\n\\n“You don’t know what my life has been since I came here. Wanting\\n\\nthings, scheming for them, lying, cheating, running up bills, promising\\n\\nto pay—oh! I hate myself when I think of it all! That’s what brought us\\n\\ntogether, Ralph and I. We were both weak! I understood him, and I was\\n\\nsorry—because I’m the same underneath. We’re not strong enough to stand\\n\\nalone, either of us. We’re weak, miserable, despicable things.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe looked at Blunt and suddenly stamped her foot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why do you look at me like that—as though you couldn’t believe? I may\\n\\nbe a thief—but at any rate I’m real now. I’m not lying any more. I’m\\n\\nnot pretending to be the kind of girl you like, young and innocent and\\n\\nsimple. I don’t care if you never want to see me again. I hate myself,\\n\\ndespise myself—but you’ve got to believe one thing, if speaking the\\n\\ntruth would have made things better for Ralph, I would have spoken out.\\n\\nBut I’ve seen all along that it wouldn’t be better for Ralph—it makes\\n\\nthe case against him blacker than ever. I was not doing him any harm by\\n\\nsticking to my lie.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ralph,” said Blunt. “I see—always Ralph.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don’t understand,” said Flora hopelessly. “You never will.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe turned to the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I admit everything; I was at my wit’s end for money. I never saw my\\n\\nuncle that evening after he left the dinner-table. As to the money, you\\n\\ncan take what steps you please. Nothing could be worse than it is now!”\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly she broke down again, hid her face in her hands, and rushed\\n\\nfrom the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” said the inspector in a flat tone, “so that’s that.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe seemed rather at a loss what to do next.\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt came forward.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Inspector Raglan,” he said quietly, “that money was given to me by Mr.\\n\\nAckroyd for a special purpose. Miss Ackroyd never touched it. When she\\n\\nsays she did, she is lying with the idea of shielding Captain Paton.\\n\\nThe truth is as I said, and I am prepared to go into the witness box\\n\\nand swear to it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe made a kind of jerky bow, then turning abruptly, he left the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot was after him in a flash. He caught the other up in the hall.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Monsieur—a moment, I beg of you, if you will be so good.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, sir?”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt was obviously impatient. He stood frowning down on Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is this,” said Poirot rapidly: “I am not deceived by your little\\n\\nfantasy. No, indeed. It was truly Miss Flora who took the money. All\\n\\nthe same it is well imagined what you say—it pleases me. It is very\\n\\ngood what you have done there. You are a man quick to think and to act.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m not in the least anxious for your opinion, thank you,” said Blunt\\n\\ncoldly.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe made once more as though to pass on, but Poirot, not at all\\n\\noffended, laid a detaining hand on his arm.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! but you are to listen to me. I have more to say. The other day I\\n\\nspoke of concealments. Very well, all along have I seen what you are\\n\\nconcealing. Mademoiselle Flora, you love her with all your heart. From\\n\\nthe first moment you saw her, is it not so? Oh! let us not mind saying\\n\\nthese things—why must one in England think it necessary to mention\\n\\nlove as though it were some disgraceful secret? You love Mademoiselle\\n\\nFlora. You seek to conceal that fact from all the world. That is very\\n\\ngood—that is as it should be. But take the advice of Hercule Poirot—do\\n\\nnot conceal it from mademoiselle herself.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt had shown several signs of restlessness whilst Poirot was\\n\\nspeaking, but the closing words seemed to rivet his attention.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What d’you mean by that?” he said sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You think that she loves the Capitaine Ralph Paton—but I, Hercule\\n\\nPoirot, tell you that that is not so. Mademoiselle Flora accepted\\n\\nCaptain Paton to please her uncle, and because she saw in the marriage\\n\\na way of escape from her life here which was becoming frankly\\n\\ninsupportable to her. She liked him, and there was much sympathy\\n\\nand understanding between them. But love—no! It is not Captain Paton\\n\\nMademoiselle Flora loves.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What the devil do you mean?” asked Blunt.\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw the dark flush under his tan.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have been blind, monsieur. Blind! She is loyal, the little one.\\n\\nRalph Paton is under a cloud, she is bound in honor to stick by him.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI felt it was time I put in a word to help on the good work.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My sister told me the other night,” I said encouragingly, “that Flora\\n\\nhad never cared a penny piece for Ralph Paton, and never would. My\\n\\nsister is always right about these things.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt ignored my well-meant efforts. He spoke to Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“D’you really think——” he began, and stopped.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe is one of those inarticulate men who find it hard to put things into\\n\\nwords.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot knows no such disability.\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you doubt me, ask her yourself, monsieur. But perhaps you no longer\\n\\ncare to—the affair of the money——”\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt gave a sound like an angry laugh.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Think I’d hold that against her? Roger was always a queer chap about\\n\\nmoney. She got in a mess and didn’t dare tell him. Poor kid. Poor\\n\\nlonely kid.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot looked thoughtfully at the side door.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mademoiselle Flora went into the garden, I think,” he murmured.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve been every kind of a fool,” said Blunt abruptly. “Rum\\n\\nconversation we’ve been having. Like one of those Danish plays. But\\n\\nyou’re a sound fellow, M. Poirot. Thank you.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe took Poirot’s hand and gave it a grip which caused the other to\\n\\nwince in anguish. Then he strode to the side door and passed out into\\n\\nthe garden.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not every kind of a fool,” murmured Poirot, tenderly nursing the\\n\\ninjured member. “Only one kind—the fool in love.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XX\\n\\n\\n\\n                             MISS RUSSELL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInspector Raglan had received a bad jolt. He was not deceived by\\n\\nBlunt’s valiant lie any more than we had been. Our way back to the\\n\\nvillage was punctuated by his complaints.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This alters everything, this does. I don’t know whether you’ve\\n\\nrealized it, Monsieur Poirot?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think so, yes, I think so,” said Poirot. “You see, me, I have been\\n\\nfamiliar with the idea for some time.”\\n\\n\\n\\nInspector Raglan, who had only had the idea presented to him a short\\n\\nhalf-hour ago, looked at Poirot unhappily, and went on with his\\n\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Those alibis now. Worthless! Absolutely worthless. Got to start\\n\\nagain. Find out what every one was doing from nine-thirty onwards.\\n\\nNine-thirty—that’s the time we’ve got to hang on to. You were quite\\n\\nright about the man Kent—we don’t release _him_ yet awhile. Let me see\\n\\nnow—nine-forty-five at the Dog and Whistle. He might have got there\\n\\nin a quarter of an hour if he ran. It’s just possible that it was\\n\\n_his_ voice Mr. Raymond heard talking to Mr. Ackroyd—asking for money\\n\\nwhich Mr. Ackroyd refused. But one thing’s clear—it wasn’t he who\\n\\nsent the telephone message. The station is half a mile in the other\\n\\ndirection—over a mile and a half from the Dog and Whistle, and he was\\n\\nat the Dog and Whistle until about ten minutes past ten. Dang that\\n\\ntelephone call! We always come up against it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“We do indeed,” agreed Poirot. “It is curious.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s just possible that if Captain Paton climbed into his uncle’s room\\n\\nand found him there murdered, _he_ may have sent it. Got the wind up,\\n\\nthought he’d be accused, and cleared out. That’s possible, isn’t it?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why should he have telephoned?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“May have had doubts if the old man was really dead. Thought he’d\\n\\nget the doctor up there as soon as possible, but didn’t want to give\\n\\nhimself away. Yes, I say now, how’s that for a theory? Something in\\n\\nthat, I should say.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inspector swelled his chest out importantly. He was so plainly\\n\\ndelighted with himself that any words of ours would have been quite\\n\\nsuperfluous.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe arrived back at my house at this minute, and I hurried in to my\\n\\nsurgery patients, who had all been waiting a considerable time, leaving\\n\\nPoirot to walk to the police station with the inspector.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving dismissed the last patient, I strolled into the little room at\\n\\nthe back of the house which I call my workshop—I am rather proud of the\\n\\nhome-made wireless set I turned out. Caroline hates my workroom. I keep\\n\\nmy tools there, and Annie is not allowed to wreak havoc with a dustpan\\n\\nand brush. I was just adjusting the interior of an alarm clock which\\n\\nhad been denounced as wholly unreliable by the household, when the door\\n\\nopened and Caroline put her head in.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! there you are, James,” she said, with deep disapproval. “M. Poirot\\n\\nwants to see you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well,” I said, rather irritably, for her sudden entrance had startled\\n\\nme and I had let go of a piece of delicate mechanism, “if he wants to\\n\\nsee me, he can come in here.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“In here?” said Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s what I said—in here.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline gave a sniff of disapproval and retired. She returned in a\\n\\nmoment or two, ushering in Poirot, and then retired again, shutting the\\n\\ndoor with a bang.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Aha! my friend,” said Poirot, coming forward and rubbing his hands.\\n\\n“You have not got rid of me so easily, you see!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Finished with the inspector?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“For the moment, yes. And you, you have seen all the patients?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot sat down and looked at me, tilting his egg-shaped head on one\\n\\nside, with the air of one who savors a very delicious joke.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are in error,” he said at last. “You have still one patient to\\n\\nsee.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not you?” I exclaimed in surprise.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah, not me, _bien entendu_. Me, I have the health magnificent. No, to\\n\\ntell you the truth, it is a little _complot_ of mine. There is some one\\n\\nI wish to see, you understand—and at the same time it is not necessary\\n\\nthat the whole village should intrigue itself about the matter—which is\\n\\nwhat would happen if the lady were seen to come to my house—for it is\\n\\na lady. But to you she has already come as a patient before.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Miss Russell!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Précisément._ I wish much to speak with her, so I send her the little\\n\\nnote and make the appointment in your surgery. You are not annoyed with\\n\\nme?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“On the contrary,” I said. “That is, presuming I am allowed to be\\n\\npresent at the interview?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But naturally! In your own surgery!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You know,” I said, throwing down the pincers I was holding, “it’s\\n\\nextraordinarily intriguing, the whole thing. Every new development that\\n\\narises is like the shake you give to a kaleidoscope—the thing changes\\n\\nentirely in aspect. Now, why are you so anxious to see Miss Russell?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot raised his eyebrows.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Surely it is obvious?” he murmured.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There you go again,” I grumbled. “According to you everything is\\n\\nobvious. But you leave me walking about in a fog.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot shook his head genially at me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You mock yourself at me. Take the matter of Mademoiselle Flora. The\\n\\ninspector was surprised—but you—you were not.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I never dreamed of her being the thief,” I expostulated.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That—perhaps no. But I was watching your face and you were not—like\\n\\nInspector Raglan—startled and incredulous.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI thought for a minute or two.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps you are right,” I said at last. “All along I’ve felt that\\n\\nFlora was keeping back something—so the truth, when it came, was\\n\\nsubconsciously expected. It upset Inspector Raglan very much indeed,\\n\\npoor man.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! _pour ça, oui_! The poor man must rearrange all his ideas. I\\n\\nprofited by his state of mental chaos to induce him to grant me a\\n\\nlittle favor.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What was that?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot took a sheet of notepaper from his pocket. Some words were\\n\\nwritten on it, and he read them aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The police have, for some days, been seeking for Captain Ralph Paton,\\n\\nthe nephew of Mr. Ackroyd of Fernly Park, whose death occurred under\\n\\nsuch tragic circumstances last Friday. Captain Paton has been found at\\n\\nLiverpool, where he was on the point of embarking for America.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe folded up the piece of paper again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That, my friend, will be in the newspapers to-morrow morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI stared at him, dumbfounded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But—but it isn’t true! He’s not at Liverpool!”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot beamed on me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have the intelligence so quick! No, he has not been found at\\n\\nLiverpool. Inspector Raglan was very loath to let me send this\\n\\nparagraph to the press, especially as I could not take him into my\\n\\nconfidence. But I assured him most solemnly that very interesting\\n\\nresults would follow its appearance in print, so he gave in, after\\n\\nstipulating that he was, on no account, to bear the responsibility.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI stared at Poirot. He smiled back at me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It beats me,” I said at last, “what you expect to get out of that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You should employ your little gray cells,” said Poirot gravely.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe rose and came across to the bench.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is that you have really the love of the machinery,” he said, after\\n\\ninspecting the débris of my labors.\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery man has his hobby. I immediately drew Poirot’s attention to my\\n\\nhome-made wireless. Finding him sympathetic, I showed him one or two\\n\\nlittle inventions of my own—trifling things, but useful in the house.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Decidedly,” said Poirot, “you should be an inventor by trade, not a\\n\\ndoctor. But I hear the bell—that is your patient. Let us go into the\\n\\nsurgery.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce before I had been struck by the remnants of beauty in the\\n\\nhousekeeper’s face. This morning I was struck anew. Very simply dressed\\n\\nin black, tall, upright and independent as ever, with her big dark eyes\\n\\nand an unwonted flush of color in her usually pale cheeks, I realized\\n\\nthat as a girl she must have been startlingly handsome.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good-morning, mademoiselle,” said Poirot. “Will you be seated? Dr.\\n\\nSheppard is so kind as to permit me the use of his surgery for a little\\n\\nconversation I am anxious to have with you.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMiss Russell sat down with her usual composure. If she felt any inward\\n\\nagitation, it did not display itself in any outward manifestation.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It seems a queer way of doing things, if you’ll allow me to say so,”\\n\\nshe remarked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Miss Russell—I have news to give you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Indeed!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Charles Kent has been arrested at Liverpool.”\\n\\n\\n\\nNot a muscle of her face moved. She merely opened her eyes a trifle\\n\\nwider, and asked, with a tinge of defiance:\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, what of it?”\\n\\n\\n\\nBut at that moment it came to me—the resemblance that had haunted me\\n\\nall along, something familiar in the defiance of Charles Kent’s manner.\\n\\nThe two voices, one rough and coarse, the other painfully ladylike—were\\n\\nstrangely the same in timbre. It was of Miss Russell that I had been\\n\\nreminded that night outside the gates of Fernly Park.\\n\\n\\n\\nI looked at Poirot, full of my discovery, and he gave me an\\n\\nimperceptible nod.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn answer to Miss Russell’s question, he threw out his hands in a\\n\\nthoroughly French gesture.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thought you might be interested, that is all,” he said mildly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, I’m not particularly,” said Miss Russell. “Who is this Charles\\n\\nKent anyway?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He is a man, mademoiselle, who was at Fernly on the night of the\\n\\nmurder.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Really?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Fortunately for him, he has an alibi. At a quarter to ten he was at a\\n\\npublic-house a mile from here.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Lucky for him,” commented Miss Russell.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But we still do not know what he was doing at Fernly—who it was he\\n\\nwent to meet, for instance.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m afraid I can’t help you at all,” said the housekeeper politely.\\n\\n“Nothing came to _my_ ears. If that is all——”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe made a tentative movement as though to rise. Poirot stopped her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is not quite all,” he said smoothly. “This morning fresh\\n\\ndevelopments have arisen. It seems now that Mr. Ackroyd was murdered,\\n\\nnot at a quarter to ten, but _before_. Between ten minutes to nine,\\n\\nwhen Dr. Sheppard left, and a quarter to ten.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw the color drain from the housekeeper’s face, leaving it dead\\n\\nwhite. She leaned forward, her figure swaying.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But Miss Ackroyd said—Miss Ackroyd said——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Miss Ackroyd has admitted that she was lying. She was never in the\\n\\nstudy at all that evening.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then——?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then it would seem that in this Charles Kent we have the man we are\\n\\nlooking for. He came to Fernly, can give no account of what he was\\n\\ndoing there——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can tell you what he was doing there. He never touched a hair of old\\n\\nAckroyd’s head—he never went near the study. He didn’t do it, I tell\\n\\nyou.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was leaning forward. That iron self-control was broken through at\\n\\nlast. Terror and desperation were in her face.\\n\\n\\n\\n“M. Poirot! M. Poirot! Oh, do believe me.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot got up and came to her. He patted her reassuringly on the\\n\\nshoulder.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But yes—but yes, I will believe. I had to make you speak, you know.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFor an instant suspicion flared up in her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is what you said true?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That Charles Kent is suspected of the crime? Yes, that is true. You\\n\\nalone can save him, by telling the reason for his being at Fernly.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He came to see me.” She spoke in a low, hurried voice. “I went out to\\n\\nmeet him——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“In the summer-house, yes, I know.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How do you know?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mademoiselle, it is the business of Hercule Poirot to know things. I\\n\\nknow that you went out earlier in the evening, that you left a message\\n\\nin the summer-house to say what time you would be there.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I did. I had heard from him—saying he was coming. I dared not\\n\\nlet him come to the house. I wrote to the address he gave me and said\\n\\nI would meet him in the summer-house, and described it to him so that\\n\\nhe would be able to find it. Then I was afraid he might not wait there\\n\\npatiently, and I ran out and left a piece of paper to say I would be\\n\\nthere about ten minutes past nine. I didn’t want the servants to see\\n\\nme, so I slipped out through the drawing-room window. As I came back, I\\n\\nmet Dr. Sheppard, and I fancied that he would think it queer. I was out\\n\\nof breath, for I had been running. I had no idea that he was expected\\n\\nto dinner that night.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe paused.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Go on,” said Poirot. “You went out to meet him at ten minutes past\\n\\nnine. What did you say to each other?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s difficult. You see——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mademoiselle,” said Poirot, interrupting her, “in this matter I must\\n\\nhave the whole truth. What you tell us need never go beyond these four\\n\\nwalls. Dr. Sheppard will be discreet, and so shall I. See, I will help\\n\\nyou. This Charles Kent, he is your son, is he not?”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe nodded. The color had flamed into her cheeks.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No one has ever known. It was long ago—long ago—down in Kent. I was\\n\\nnot married....”\\n\\n\\n\\n“So you took the name of the county as a surname for him. I understand.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I got work. I managed to pay for his board and lodging. I never told\\n\\nhim that I was his mother. But he turned out badly, he drank, then took\\n\\nto drugs. I managed to pay his passage out to Canada. I didn’t hear of\\n\\nhim for a year or two. Then, somehow or other, he found out that I was\\n\\nhis mother. He wrote asking me for money. Finally, I heard from him\\n\\nback in this country again. He was coming to see me at Fernly, he said.\\n\\nI dared not let him come to the house. I have always been considered\\n\\nso—so very respectable. If any one got an inkling—it would have been\\n\\nall up with my post as housekeeper. So I wrote to him in the way I have\\n\\njust told you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And in the morning you came to see Dr. Sheppard?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes. I wondered if something could be done. He was not a bad\\n\\nboy—before he took to drugs.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I see,” said Poirot. “Now let us go on with the story. He came that\\n\\nnight to the summer-house?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, he was waiting for me when I got there. He was very rough and\\n\\nabusive. I had brought with me all the money I had, and I gave it to\\n\\nhim. We talked a little, and then he went away.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What time was that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It must have been between twenty and twenty-five minutes past nine. It\\n\\nwas not yet half-past when I got back to the house.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Which way did he go?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Straight out the same way he came, by the path that joined the drive\\n\\njust inside the lodge gates.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And you, what did you do?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I went back to the house. Major Blunt was walking up and down the\\n\\nterrace smoking, so I made a detour to get round to the side door. It\\n\\nwas then just on half-past nine, as I tell you.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded again. He made a note or two in a microscopic pocket-book.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think that is all,” he said thoughtfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ought I——” she hesitated. “Ought I to tell all this to Inspector\\n\\nRaglan?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It may come to that. But let us not be in a hurry. Let us proceed\\n\\nslowly, with due order and method. Charles Kent is not yet formally\\n\\ncharged with murder. Circumstances may arise which will render your\\n\\nstory unnecessary.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMiss Russell rose.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Thank you very much, M. Poirot,” she said. “You have been very\\n\\nkind—very kind indeed. You—you do believe me, don’t you? That Charles\\n\\nhad nothing to do with this wicked murder!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“There seems no doubt that the man who was talking to Mr. Ackroyd in\\n\\nthe library at nine-thirty could not possibly have been your son. Be of\\n\\ngood courage, mademoiselle. All will yet be well.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMiss Russell departed. Poirot and I were left together.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So that’s that,” I said. “Every time we come back to Ralph Paton. How\\n\\ndid you manage to spot Miss Russell as the person Charles Kent came to\\n\\nmeet? Did you notice the resemblance?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I had connected her with the unknown man long before we actually\\n\\ncame face to face with him. As soon as we found that quill. The quill\\n\\nsuggested dope, and I remembered your account of Miss Russell’s visit\\n\\nto you. Then I found the article on cocaine in that morning’s paper. It\\n\\nall seemed very clear. She had heard from some one that morning—some\\n\\none addicted to drugs, she read the article in the paper, and she came\\n\\nto you to ask a few tentative questions. She mentioned cocaine, since\\n\\nthe article in question was on cocaine. Then, when you seemed too\\n\\ninterested, she switched hurriedly to the subject of detective stories\\n\\nand untraceable poisons. I suspected a son or a brother, or some other\\n\\nundesirable male relation. Ah! but I must go. It is the time of the\\n\\nlunch.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Stay and lunch with us,” I suggested.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot shook his head. A faint twinkle came into his eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not again to-day. I should not like to force Mademoiselle Caroline to\\n\\nadopt a vegetarian diet two days in succession.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIt occurred to me that there was not much which escaped Hercule Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XXI\\n\\n\\n\\n                      THE PARAGRAPH IN THE PAPER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline, of course, had not failed to see Miss Russell come\\n\\nto the surgery door. I had anticipated this, and had ready an\\n\\nelaborate account of the lady’s bad knee. But Caroline was not in a\\n\\ncross-questioning mood. Her point of view was that she knew what Miss\\n\\nRussell had really come for and that _I_ didn’t.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pumping you, James,” said Caroline. “Pumping you in the most shameless\\n\\nmanner, I’ve not a doubt. It’s no good interrupting. I dare say you\\n\\nhadn’t the least idea she was doing it even. Men _are_ so simple. She\\n\\nknows that you are in M. Poirot’s confidence, and she wants to find out\\n\\nthings. Do you know what I think, James?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I couldn’t begin to imagine. You think so many extraordinary things.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It’s no good being sarcastic. I think Miss Russell knows more about\\n\\nMr. Ackroyd’s death than she is prepared to admit.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline leaned back triumphantly in her chair.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you really think so?” I said absently.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are very dull to-day, James. No animation about you. It’s that\\n\\nliver of yours.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOur conversation then dealt with purely personal matters.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe paragraph inspired by Poirot duly appeared in our daily paper the\\n\\nnext morning. I was in the dark as to its purpose, but its effect on\\n\\nCaroline was immense.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe began by stating, most untruly, that she had said as much all\\n\\nalong. I raised my eyebrows, but did not argue. Caroline, however, must\\n\\nhave felt a prick of conscience, for she went on:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“I mayn’t have actually mentioned Liverpool, but I knew he’d try to get\\n\\naway to America. That’s what Crippen did.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Without much success,” I reminded her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Poor boy, and so they’ve caught him. I consider, James, that it’s your\\n\\nduty to see that he isn’t hung.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What do you expect me to do?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why, you’re a medical man, aren’t you? You’ve known him from a boy\\n\\nupwards. Not mentally responsible. That’s the line to take, clearly. I\\n\\nread only the other day that they’re very happy in Broadmoor—it’s quite\\n\\nlike a high-class club.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Caroline’s words had reminded me of something.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I never knew that Poirot had an imbecile nephew?” I said curiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Didn’t you? Oh, he told me all about it. Poor lad. It’s a great grief\\n\\nto all the family. They’ve kept him at home so far, but it’s getting\\n\\nto such a pitch that they’re afraid he’ll have to go into some kind of\\n\\ninstitution.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I suppose you know pretty well everything there is to know about\\n\\nPoirot’s family by this time,” I said, exasperated.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Pretty well,” said Caroline complacently. “It’s a great relief to\\n\\npeople to be able to tell all their troubles to some one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It might be,” I said, “if they were ever allowed to do so\\n\\nspontaneously. Whether they enjoy having confidences screwed out of\\n\\nthem by force is another matter.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline merely looked at me with the air of a Christian martyr\\n\\nenjoying martyrdom.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are so self-contained, James,” she said. “You hate speaking out,\\n\\nor parting with any information yourself, and you think everybody else\\n\\nmust be just like you. I should hope that I never screw confidences out\\n\\nof anybody. For instance, if M. Poirot comes in this afternoon, as he\\n\\nsaid he might do, I shall not dream of asking him who it was arrived at\\n\\nhis house early this morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Early this morning?” I queried.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very early,” said Caroline. “Before the milk came. I just happened\\n\\nto be looking out of the window—the blind was flapping. It was a man.\\n\\nHe came in a closed car, and he was all muffled up. I couldn’t get a\\n\\nglimpse of his face. But I will tell you _my_ idea, and you’ll see that\\n\\nI’m right.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s your idea?”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline dropped her voice mysteriously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A Home Office expert,” she breathed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A Home Office expert,” I said, amazed. “My dear Caroline!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mark my words, James, you’ll see that I’m right. That Russell woman\\n\\nwas here that morning after your poisons. Roger Ackroyd might easily\\n\\nhave been poisoned in his food that night.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI laughed out loud.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense,” I cried. “He was stabbed in the neck. You know that as well\\n\\nas I do.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“After death, James,” said Caroline; “to make a false clew.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My good woman,” I said, “I examined the body, and I know what I’m\\n\\ntalking about. That wound wasn’t inflicted after death—it was the cause\\n\\nof death, and you need make no mistake about it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline merely continued to look omniscient, which so annoyed me that\\n\\nI went on:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Perhaps you will tell me, Caroline, if I have a medical degree or if I\\n\\nhave not?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have the medical degree, I dare say, James—at least, I mean I know\\n\\nyou have. But you’ve no imagination whatever.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Having endowed you with a treble portion, there was none left over for\\n\\nme,” I said dryly.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was amused to notice Caroline’s maneuvers that afternoon when Poirot\\n\\nduly arrived. My sister, without asking a direct question, skirted the\\n\\nsubject of the mysterious guest in every way imaginable. By the twinkle\\n\\nin Poirot’s eyes, I saw that he realized her object. He remained\\n\\nblandly impervious, and blocked her bowling so successfully that she\\n\\nherself was at a loss how to proceed.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving, I suspect, quietly enjoyed the little game, he rose to his feet\\n\\nand suggested a walk.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is that I need to reduce the figure a little,” he explained. “You\\n\\nwill come with me, doctor? And perhaps later Miss Caroline will give us\\n\\nsome tea.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Delighted,” said Caroline. “Won’t your—er—guest come in also?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are too kind,” said Poirot. “But no, my friend reposes himself.\\n\\nSoon you must make his acquaintance.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite an old friend of yours, so somebody told me,” said Caroline,\\n\\nmaking one last valiant effort.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did they?” murmured Poirot. “Well, we must start.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOur tramp took us in the direction of Fernly. I had guessed beforehand\\n\\nthat it might do so. I was beginning to understand Poirot’s methods.\\n\\nEvery little irrelevancy had a bearing upon the whole.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have a commission for you, my friend,” he said at last. “To-night,\\n\\nat my house, I desire to have a little conference. You will attend,\\n\\nwill you not?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Good. I need also all those in the house—that is to say: Mrs. Ackroyd,\\n\\nMademoiselle Flora, Major Blunt, M. Raymond. I want you to be my\\n\\nambassador. This little reunion is fixed for nine o’clock. You will ask\\n\\nthem—yes?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“With pleasure; but why not ask them yourself?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Because they will then put the questions: Why? What for? They will\\n\\ndemand what my idea is. And, as you know, my friend, I much dislike to\\n\\nhave to explain my little ideas until the time comes.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI smiled a little.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My friend Hastings, he of whom I told you, used to say of me that I\\n\\nwas the human oyster. But he was unjust. Of facts, I keep nothing to\\n\\nmyself. But to every one his own interpretation of them.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“When do you want me to do this?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now, if you will. We are close to the house.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Aren’t you coming in?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, me, I will promenade myself in the grounds. I will rejoin you by\\n\\nthe lodge gates in a quarter of an hour’s time.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI nodded, and set off on my task. The only member of the family at home\\n\\nproved to be Mrs. Ackroyd, who was sipping an early cup of tea. She\\n\\nreceived me very graciously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So grateful to you, doctor,” she murmured, “for clearing up that\\n\\nlittle matter with M. Poirot. But life is one trouble after another.\\n\\nYou have heard about Flora, of course?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“What exactly?” I asked cautiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This new engagement. Flora and Hector Blunt. Of course not such a good\\n\\nmatch as Ralph would have been. But after all, happiness comes first.\\n\\nWhat dear Flora needs is an older man—some one steady and reliable, and\\n\\nthen Hector is really a very distinguished man in his way. You saw the\\n\\nnews of Ralph’s arrest in the paper this morning?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes,” I said, “I did.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Horrible.” Mrs. Ackroyd closed her eyes and shuddered. “Geoffrey\\n\\nRaymond was in a terrible way. Rang up Liverpool. But they wouldn’t\\n\\ntell him anything at the police station there. In fact, they said\\n\\nthey hadn’t arrested Ralph at all. Mr. Raymond insists that it’s all\\n\\na mistake—a—what do they call it?—_canard_ of the newspaper’s. I’ve\\n\\nforbidden it to be mentioned before the servants. Such a terrible\\n\\ndisgrace. Fancy if Flora had actually been married to him.”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd shut her eyes in anguish. I began to wonder how soon I\\n\\nshould be able to deliver Poirot’s invitation.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore I had time to speak, Mrs. Ackroyd was off again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You were here yesterday, weren’t you, with that dreadful Inspector\\n\\nRaglan? Brute of a man—he terrified Flora into saying she took that\\n\\nmoney from poor Roger’s room. And the matter was so simple, really. The\\n\\ndear child wanted to borrow a few pounds, didn’t like to disturb her\\n\\nuncle since he’d given strict orders against it, but knowing where he\\n\\nkept his notes she went there and took what she needed.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is that Flora’s account of the matter?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear doctor, you know what girls are nowadays. So easily acted on\\n\\nby suggestion. You, of course, know all about hypnosis and that sort of\\n\\nthing. The inspector shouts at her, says the word ‘steal’ over and over\\n\\nagain, until the poor child gets an inhibition—or is it a complex?—I\\n\\nalways mix up those two words—and actually thinks herself that she has\\n\\nstolen the money. I saw at once how it was. But I can’t be too thankful\\n\\nfor the whole misunderstanding in one way—it seems to have brought\\n\\nthose two together—Hector and Flora, I mean. And I assure you that I\\n\\nhave been very much worried about Flora in the past: why, at one time\\n\\nI actually thought there was going to be some kind of understanding\\n\\nbetween her and young Raymond. Just think of it!” Mrs. Ackroyd’s voice\\n\\nrose in shrill horror. “A private secretary—with practically no means\\n\\nof his own.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It would have been a severe blow to you,” I said. “Now, Mrs. Ackroyd,\\n\\nI’ve got a message for you from M. Hercule Poirot.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“For me?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMrs. Ackroyd looked quite alarmed.\\n\\n\\n\\nI hastened to reassure her, and I explained what Poirot wanted.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly,” said Mrs. Ackroyd rather doubtfully, “I suppose we must\\n\\ncome if M. Poirot says so. But what is it all about? I like to know\\n\\nbeforehand.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI assured the lady truthfully that I myself did not know any more than\\n\\nshe did.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Very well,” said Mrs. Ackroyd at last, rather grudgingly, “I will tell\\n\\nthe others, and we will be there at nine o’clock.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThereupon I took my leave, and joined Poirot at the agreed\\n\\nmeeting-place.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’ve been longer than a quarter of an hour, I’m afraid,” I remarked.\\n\\n“But once that good lady starts talking it’s a matter of the utmost\\n\\ndifficulty to get a word in edgeways.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is of no matter,” said Poirot. “Me, I have been well amused. This\\n\\npark is magnificent.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe set off homewards. When we arrived, to our great surprise Caroline,\\n\\nwho had evidently been watching for us, herself opened the door.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe put her fingers to her lips. Her face was full of importance and\\n\\nexcitement.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ursula Bourne,” she said, “the parlormaid from Fernly. She’s here!\\n\\nI’ve put her in the dining-room. She’s in a terrible way, poor thing.\\n\\nSays she must see M. Poirot at once. I’ve done all I could. Taken her a\\n\\ncup of hot tea. It really goes to one’s heart to see any one in such a\\n\\nstate.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“In the dining-room?” asked Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This way,” I said, and flung open the door.\\n\\n\\n\\nUrsula Bourne was sitting by the table. Her arms were spread out in\\n\\nfront of her, and she had evidently just lifted her head from where it\\n\\nhad been buried. Her eyes were red with weeping.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ursula Bourne,” I murmured.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Poirot went past me with outstretched hands.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” he said, “that is not quite right, I think. It is not Ursula\\n\\nBourne, is it, my child—but Ursula Paton? Mrs. Ralph Paton.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXII\\n\\n\\n\\n                            URSULA’S STORY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment or two the girl looked mutely at Poirot. Then, her reserve\\n\\nbreaking down completely, she nodded her head once, and burst into an\\n\\noutburst of sobs.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline pushed past me, and putting her arm round the girl, patted her\\n\\non the shoulder.\\n\\n\\n\\n“There, there, my dear,” she said soothingly, “it will be all right.\\n\\nYou’ll see—everything will be all right.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBuried under curiosity and scandal-mongering there is a lot of kindness\\n\\nin Caroline. For the moment, even the interest of Poirot’s revelation\\n\\nwas lost in the sight of the girl’s distress.\\n\\n\\n\\nPresently Ursula sat up and wiped her eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This is very weak and silly of me,” she said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No, no, my child,” said Poirot kindly. “We can all realize the strain\\n\\nof this last week.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It must have been a terrible ordeal,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And then to find that you knew,” continued Ursula. “How did you know?\\n\\nWas it Ralph who told you?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You know what brought me to you to-night,” went on the girl. “_This_——”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe held out a crumpled piece of newspaper, and I recognized the\\n\\nparagraph that Poirot had had inserted.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It says that Ralph has been arrested. So everything is useless. I need\\n\\nnot pretend any longer.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Newspaper paragraphs are not always true, mademoiselle,” murmured\\n\\nPoirot, having the grace to look ashamed of himself. “All the same, I\\n\\nthink you will do well to make a clean breast of things. The truth is\\n\\nwhat we need now.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe girl hesitated, looking at him doubtfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You do not trust me,” said Poirot gently. “Yet all the same you came\\n\\nhere to find me, did you not? Why was that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Because I don’t believe that Ralph did it,” said the girl in a very\\n\\nlow voice. “And I think that you are clever, and will find out the\\n\\ntruth. And also——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I think you are kind.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded his head several times.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is very good that—yes, it is very good. Listen, I do in verity\\n\\nbelieve that this husband of yours is innocent—but the affair marches\\n\\nbadly. If I am to save him, I must know all there is to know—even if it\\n\\nshould seem to make the case against him blacker than before.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“How well you understand,” said Ursula.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So you will tell me the whole story, will you not? From the beginning.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re not going to send _me_ away, I hope,” said Caroline, settling\\n\\nherself comfortably in an arm-chair. “What I want to know,” she\\n\\ncontinued, “is why this child was masquerading as a parlormaid?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Masquerading?” I queried.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s what I said. Why did you do it, child? For a wager?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“For a living,” said Ursula dryly.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd encouraged, she began the story which I reproduce here in my own\\n\\nwords.\\n\\n\\n\\nUrsula Bourne, it seemed, was one of a family of seven—impoverished\\n\\nIrish gentlefolk. On the death of her father, most of the girls were\\n\\ncast out into the world to earn their own living. Ursula’s eldest\\n\\nsister was married to Captain Folliott. It was she whom I had seen\\n\\nthat Sunday, and the cause of her embarrassment was clear enough now.\\n\\nDetermined to earn her living and not attracted to the idea of being a\\n\\nnursery governess—the one profession open to an untrained girl, Ursula\\n\\npreferred the job of parlormaid. She scorned to label herself a “lady\\n\\nparlormaid.” She would be the real thing, her reference being supplied\\n\\nby her sister. At Fernly, despite an aloofness which, as has been seen,\\n\\ncaused some comment, she was a success at her job—quick, competent, and\\n\\nthorough.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I enjoyed the work,” she explained. “And I had plenty of time to\\n\\nmyself.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then came her meeting with Ralph Paton, and the love affair which\\n\\nculminated in a secret marriage. Ralph had persuaded her into that,\\n\\nsomewhat against her will. He had declared that his stepfather would\\n\\nnot hear of his marrying a penniless girl. Better to be married\\n\\nsecretly, and break the news to him at some later and more favorable\\n\\nminute.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so the deed was done, and Ursula Bourne became Ursula Paton.\\n\\nRalph had declared that he meant to pay off his debts, find a job, and\\n\\nthen, when he was in a position to support her, and independent of his\\n\\nadopted father, they would break the news to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut to people like Ralph Paton, turning over a new leaf is easier in\\n\\ntheory than in practice. He hoped that his stepfather, whilst still\\n\\nin ignorance of the marriage, might be persuaded to pay his debts and\\n\\nput him on his feet again. But the revelation of the amount of Ralph’s\\n\\nliabilities merely enraged Roger Ackroyd, and he refused to do anything\\n\\nat all. Some months passed, and then Ralph was bidden once more to\\n\\nFernly. Roger Ackroyd did not beat about the bush. It was the desire of\\n\\nhis heart that Ralph should marry Flora, and he put the matter plainly\\n\\nbefore the young man.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd here it was that the innate weakness of Ralph Paton showed itself.\\n\\nAs always, he grasped at the easy, the immediate solution. As far\\n\\nas I could make out, neither Flora nor Ralph made any pretence of\\n\\nlove. It was, on both sides, a business arrangement. Roger Ackroyd\\n\\ndictated his wishes—they agreed to them. Flora accepted a chance of\\n\\nliberty, money, and an enlarged horizon, Ralph, of course, was playing\\n\\na different game. But he was in a very awkward hole financially. He\\n\\nseized at the chance. His debts would be paid. He could start again\\n\\nwith a clean sheet. His was not a nature to envisage the future, but\\n\\nI gather that he saw vaguely the engagement with Flora being broken\\n\\noff after a decent interval had elapsed. Both Flora and he stipulated\\n\\nthat it should be kept a secret for the present. He was anxious to\\n\\nconceal it from Ursula. He felt instinctively that her nature, strong\\n\\nand resolute, with an inherent distaste for duplicity, was not one to\\n\\nwelcome such a course.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen came the crucial moment when Roger Ackroyd, always high-handed,\\n\\ndecided to announce the engagement. He said no word of his intention\\n\\nto Ralph—only to Flora, and Flora, apathetic, raised no objection. On\\n\\nUrsula, the news fell like a bombshell. Summoned by her, Ralph came\\n\\nhurriedly down from town. They met in the wood, where part of their\\n\\nconversation was overheard by my sister. Ralph implored her to keep\\n\\nsilent for a little while longer, Ursula was equally determined to have\\n\\ndone with concealments. She would tell Mr. Ackroyd the truth without\\n\\nany further delay. Husband and wife parted acrimoniously.\\n\\n\\n\\nUrsula, steadfast in her purpose, sought an interview with Roger\\n\\nAckroyd that very afternoon, and revealed the truth to him. Their\\n\\ninterview was a stormy one—it might have been even more stormy had not\\n\\nRoger Ackroyd been already obsessed with his own troubles. It was bad\\n\\nenough, however. Ackroyd was not the kind of man to forgive the deceit\\n\\nthat had been practiced upon him. His rancor was mainly directed to\\n\\nRalph, but Ursula came in for her share, since he regarded her as a\\n\\ngirl who had deliberately tried to “entrap” the adopted son of a very\\n\\nwealthy man. Unforgivable things were said on both sides.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat same evening Ursula met Ralph by appointment in the small\\n\\nsummer-house, stealing out from the house by the side door in order to\\n\\ndo so. Their interview was made up of reproaches on both sides. Ralph\\n\\ncharged Ursula with having irretrievably ruined his prospects by her\\n\\nill-timed revelation. Ursula reproached Ralph with his duplicity.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey parted at last. A little over half an hour later came the\\n\\ndiscovery of Roger Ackroyd’s body. Since that night Ursula had neither\\n\\nseen nor heard from Ralph.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the story unfolded itself, I realized more and more what a damning\\n\\nseries of facts it was. Alive, Ackroyd could hardly have failed to\\n\\nalter his will—I knew him well enough to realize that to do so would\\n\\nbe his first thought. His death came in the nick of time for Ralph and\\n\\nUrsula Paton. Small wonder the girl had held her tongue, and played her\\n\\npart so consistently.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy meditations were interrupted. It was Poirot’s voice speaking, and I\\n\\nknew from the gravity of his tone that he, too, was fully alive to the\\n\\nimplications of the position.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mademoiselle, I must ask you one question, and you must answer it\\n\\ntruthfully, for on it everything may hang: What time was it when you\\n\\nparted from Captain Ralph Paton in the summer-house? Now, take a little\\n\\nminute so that your answer may be very exact.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe girl gave a half laugh, bitter enough in all conscience.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you think I haven’t gone over that again and again in my own mind?\\n\\nIt was just half-past nine when I went out to meet him. Major Blunt\\n\\nwas walking up and down the terrace, so I had to go round through the\\n\\nbushes to avoid him. It must have been about twenty-seven minutes to\\n\\nten when I reached the summer-house. Ralph was waiting for me. I was\\n\\nwith him ten minutes—not longer, for it was just a quarter to ten when\\n\\nI got back to the house.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw now the insistence of her question the other day. If only Ackroyd\\n\\ncould have been proved to have been killed before a quarter to ten, and\\n\\nnot after.\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw the reflection of that thought in Poirot’s next question.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Who left the summer-house first?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I did.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Leaving Ralph Paton in the summer-house?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes—but you don’t think——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mademoiselle, it is of no importance what I think. What did you do\\n\\nwhen you got back to the house?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I went up to my room.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And stayed there until when?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Until about ten o’clock.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Is there any one who can prove that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Prove? That I was in my room, you mean? Oh! no. But surely—oh! I see,\\n\\nthey might think—they might think——”\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw the dawning horror in her eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot finished the sentence for her.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That it was _you_ who entered by the window and stabbed Mr. Ackroyd as\\n\\nhe sat in his chair? Yes, they might think just that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nobody but a fool would think any such thing,” said Caroline\\n\\nindignantly.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe patted Ursula on the shoulder.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe girl had her face hidden in her hands.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Horrible,” she was murmuring. “Horrible.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline gave her a friendly shake.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Don’t worry, my dear,” she said. “M. Poirot doesn’t think that really.\\n\\nAs for that husband of yours, I don’t think much of him, and I tell you\\n\\nso candidly. Running away and leaving you to face the music.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Ursula shook her head energetically.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh, no,” she cried. “It wasn’t like that at all. Ralph would not run\\n\\naway on his own account. I see now. If he heard of his stepfather’s\\n\\nmurder, he might think himself that I had done it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He wouldn’t think any such thing,” said Caroline.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I was so cruel to him that night—so hard and bitter. I wouldn’t listen\\n\\nto what he was trying to say—wouldn’t believe that he really cared.\\n\\nI just stood there telling him what I thought of him, and saying the\\n\\ncoldest, cruelest things that came into my mind—trying my best to hurt\\n\\nhim.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do him no harm,” said Caroline. “Never worry about what you say to a\\n\\nman. They’re so conceited that they never believe you mean it if it’s\\n\\nunflattering.”\\n\\n\\n\\nUrsula went on, nervously twisting and untwisting her hands.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When the murder was discovered and he didn’t come forward, I was\\n\\nterribly upset. Just for a moment I wondered—but then I knew he\\n\\ncouldn’t—he couldn’t.... But I wished he would come forward and say\\n\\nopenly that he’d had nothing to do with it. I knew that he was very\\n\\nfond of Dr. Sheppard, and I fancied that perhaps Dr. Sheppard might\\n\\nknow where he was hiding.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe turned to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That’s why I said what I did to you that day. I thought, if you knew\\n\\nwhere he was, you might pass on the message to him.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I?” I exclaimed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why should James know where he was?” demanded Caroline sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was very unlikely, I know,” admitted Ursula, “but Ralph had often\\n\\nspoken of Dr. Sheppard, and I knew that he would be likely to consider\\n\\nhim as his best friend in King’s Abbot.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear child,” I said, “I have not the least idea where Ralph Paton\\n\\nis at the present moment.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is true enough,” said Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But——” Ursula held out the newspaper cutting in a puzzled fashion.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah! that,” said Poirot, slightly embarrassed; “a _bagatelle_,\\n\\nmademoiselle. A _rien du tout_. Not for a moment do I believe that\\n\\nRalph Paton has been arrested.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But then——” began the girl slowly.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot went on quickly:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“There is one thing I should like to know—did Captain Paton wear shoes\\n\\nor boots that night?”\\n\\n\\n\\nUrsula shook her head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I can’t remember.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A pity! But how should you? Now, madame,” he smiled at her, his head\\n\\non one side, his forefinger wagging eloquently, “no questions. And\\n\\ndo not torment yourself. Be of good courage, and place your faith in\\n\\nHercule Poirot.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\\n\\n\\n\\n                        POIROT’S LITTLE REUNION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“And now,” said Caroline, rising, “that child is coming upstairs to lie\\n\\ndown. Don’t you worry, my dear. M. Poirot will do everything he can for\\n\\nyou—be sure of that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I ought to go back to Fernly,” said Ursula uncertainly.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Caroline silenced her protests with a firm hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Nonsense. You’re in my hands for the time being. You’ll stay here for\\n\\nthe present, anyway—eh, M. Poirot?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It will be the best plan,” agreed the little Belgian. “This evening I\\n\\nshall want mademoiselle—I beg her pardon, madame—to attend my little\\n\\nreunion. Nine o’clock at my house. It is most necessary that she should\\n\\nbe there.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline nodded, and went with Ursula out of the room. The door shut\\n\\nbehind them. Poirot dropped down into a chair again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So far, so good,” he said. “Things are straightening themselves out.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“They’re getting to look blacker and blacker against Ralph Paton,” I\\n\\nobserved gloomily.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, that is so. But it was to be expected, was it not?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI looked at him, slightly puzzled by the remark. He was leaning back in\\n\\nthe chair, his eyes half closed, the tips of his fingers just touching\\n\\neach other. Suddenly he sighed and shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is it?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is that there are moments when a great longing for my friend\\n\\nHastings comes over me. That is the friend of whom I spoke to you—the\\n\\none who resides now in the Argentine. Always, when I have had a big\\n\\ncase, he has been by my side. And he has helped me—yes, often he has\\n\\nhelped me. For he had a knack, that one, of stumbling over the truth\\n\\nunawares—without noticing it himself, _bien entendu_. At times he has\\n\\nsaid something particularly foolish, and behold that foolish remark has\\n\\nrevealed the truth to me! And then, too, it was his practice to keep a\\n\\nwritten record of the cases that proved interesting.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI gave a slight embarrassed cough.\\n\\n\\n\\n“As far as that goes,” I began, and then stopped.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot sat upright in his chair. His eyes sparkled.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But yes? What is it that you would say?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, as a matter of fact, I’ve read some of Captain Hastings’s\\n\\nnarratives, and I thought, why not try my hand at something of the same\\n\\nkind? Seemed a pity not to—unique opportunity—probably the only time\\n\\nI’ll be mixed up with anything of this kind.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI felt myself getting hotter and hotter, and more and more incoherent,\\n\\nas I floundered through the above speech.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot sprang from his chair. I had a moment’s terror that he was going\\n\\nto embrace me French fashion, but mercifully he refrained.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But this is magnificent—you have then written down your impressions of\\n\\nthe case as you went along?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Epatant!_” cried Poirot. “Let me see them—this instant.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was not quite prepared for such a sudden demand. I racked my brains\\n\\nto remember certain details.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I hope you won’t mind,” I stammered. “I may have been a\\n\\nlittle—er—_personal_ now and then.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh! I comprehend perfectly; you have referred to me as comic—as,\\n\\nperhaps, ridiculous now and then? It matters not at all. Hastings,\\n\\nhe also was not always polite. Me, I have the mind above such\\n\\ntrivialities.”\\n\\n\\n\\nStill somewhat doubtful, I rummaged in the drawers of my desk and\\n\\nproduced an untidy pile of manuscript which I handed over to him. With\\n\\nan eye on possible publication in the future, I had divided the work\\n\\ninto chapters, and the night before I had brought it up to date with an\\n\\naccount of Miss Russell’s visit. Poirot had therefore twenty chapters.\\n\\n\\n\\nI left him with them.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was obliged to go out to a case at some distance away, and it was\\n\\npast eight o’clock when I got back, to be greeted with a plate of hot\\n\\ndinner on a tray, and the announcement that Poirot and my sister had\\n\\nsupped together at half-past seven, and that the former had then gone\\n\\nto my workshop to finish his reading of the manuscript.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I hope, James,” said my sister, “that you’ve been careful in what you\\n\\nsay about me in it?”\\n\\n\\n\\nMy jaw dropped. I had not been careful at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not that it matters very much,” said Caroline, reading my expression\\n\\ncorrectly. “M. Poirot will know what to think. He understands me much\\n\\nbetter than you do.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI went into the workshop. Poirot was sitting by the window. The\\n\\nmanuscript lay neatly piled on a chair beside him. He laid his hand on\\n\\nit and spoke.\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Eh bien_,” he said, “I congratulate you—on your modesty!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Oh!” I said, rather taken aback.\\n\\n\\n\\n“And on your reticence,” he added.\\n\\n\\n\\nI said “Oh!” again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not so did Hastings write,” continued my friend. “On every page,\\n\\nmany, many times was the word ‘I.’ What _he_ thought—what _he_ did.\\n\\nBut you—you have kept your personality in the background; only once or\\n\\ntwice does it obtrude—in scenes of home life, shall we say?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI blushed a little before the twinkle in his eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What do you really think of the stuff?” I asked nervously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You want my candid opinion?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot laid his jesting manner aside.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A very meticulous and accurate account,” he said kindly. “You have\\n\\nrecorded all the facts faithfully and exactly—though you have shown\\n\\nyourself becomingly reticent as to your own share in them.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And it has helped you?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes. I may say that it has helped me considerably. Come, we must go\\n\\nover to my house and set the stage for my little performance.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline was in the hall. I think she hoped that she might be invited\\n\\nto accompany us. Poirot dealt with the situation tactfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I should much like to have had you present, mademoiselle,” he said\\n\\nregretfully, “but at this juncture it would not be wise. See you, all\\n\\nthese people to-night are suspects. Amongst them, I shall find the\\n\\nperson who killed Mr. Ackroyd.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You really believe that?” I said incredulously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I see that you do not,” said Poirot dryly. “Not yet do you appreciate\\n\\nHercule Poirot at his true worth.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that minute Ursula came down the staircase.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are ready, my child?” said Poirot. “That is good. We will go to\\n\\nmy house together. Mademoiselle Caroline, believe me, I do everything\\n\\npossible to render you service. Good-evening.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe went out, leaving Caroline, rather like a dog who has been refused a\\n\\nwalk, standing on the front door step gazing after us.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sitting-room at The Larches had been got ready. On the table were\\n\\nvarious _sirops_ and glasses. Also a plate of biscuits. Several chairs\\n\\nhad been brought in from the other room.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot ran to and fro rearranging things. Pulling out a chair here,\\n\\naltering the position of a lamp there, occasionally stooping to\\n\\nstraighten one of the mats that covered the floor. He was specially\\n\\nfussy over the lighting. The lamps were arranged in such a way as to\\n\\nthrow a clear light on the side of the room where the chairs were\\n\\ngrouped, at the same time leaving the other end of the room, where I\\n\\npresumed Poirot himself would sit, in a dim twilight.\\n\\n\\n\\nUrsula and I watched him. Presently a bell was heard.\\n\\n\\n\\n“They arrive,” said Poirot. “Good, all is in readiness.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe door opened and the party from Fernly filed in. Poirot went forward\\n\\nand greeted Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora.\\n\\n\\n\\n“It is most good of you to come,” he said. “And Major Blunt and Mr.\\n\\nRaymond.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe secretary was debonair as ever.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s the great idea?” he said, laughing. “Some scientific machine?\\n\\nDo we have bands round our wrists which register guilty heart-beats?\\n\\nThere is such an invention, isn’t there?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have read of it, yes,” admitted Poirot. “But me, I am old-fashioned.\\n\\nI use the old methods. I work only with the little gray cells. Now let\\n\\nus begin—but first I have an announcement to make to you all.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe took Ursula’s hand and drew her forward.\\n\\n\\n\\n“This lady is Mrs. Ralph Paton. She was married to Captain Paton last\\n\\nMarch.”\\n\\n\\n\\nA little shriek burst from Mrs. Ackroyd.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ralph! Married! Last March! Oh! but it’s absurd. How could he be?”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe stared at Ursula as though she had never seen her before.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Married to Bourne?” she said. “Really, M. Poirot, I don’t believe you.”\\n\\n\\n\\nUrsula flushed and began to speak, but Flora forestalled her.\\n\\n\\n\\nGoing quickly to the other girl’s side, she passed her hand through her\\n\\narm.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You must not mind our being surprised,” she said. “You see, we had no\\n\\nidea of such a thing. You and Ralph have kept your secret very well. I\\n\\nam—very glad about it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are very kind, Miss Ackroyd,” said Ursula in a low voice, “and\\n\\nyou have every right to be exceedingly angry. Ralph behaved very\\n\\nbadly—especially to you.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You needn’t worry about that,” said Flora, giving her arm a consoling\\n\\nlittle pat. “Ralph was in a corner and took the only way out. I should\\n\\nprobably have done the same in his place. I do think he might have\\n\\ntrusted me with the secret, though. I wouldn’t have let him down.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot rapped gently on a table and cleared his throat significantly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The board meeting’s going to begin,” said Flora. “M. Poirot hints that\\n\\nwe mustn’t talk. But just tell me one thing. Where is Ralph? You must\\n\\nknow if any one does.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But I don’t,” cried Ursula, almost in a wail. “That’s just it, I\\n\\ndon’t.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Isn’t he detained at Liverpool?” asked Raymond. “It said so in the\\n\\npaper.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He is not at Liverpool,” said Poirot shortly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In fact,” I remarked, “no one knows where he is.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Excepting Hercule Poirot, eh?” said Raymond.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot replied seriously to the other’s banter.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Me, I know everything. Remember that.”\\n\\n\\n\\nGeoffrey Raymond lifted his eyebrows.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Everything?” He whistled. “Whew! that’s a tall order.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Do you mean to say you can really guess where Ralph Paton is hiding?”\\n\\nI asked incredulously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You call it guessing. I call it knowing, my friend.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“In Cranchester?” I hazarded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” replied Poirot gravely, “not in Cranchester.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said no more, but at a gesture from him the assembled party took\\n\\ntheir seats. As they did so, the door opened once more and two other\\n\\npeople came in and sat down near the door. They were Parker and the\\n\\nhousekeeper.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The number is complete,” said Poirot. “Every one is here.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a ring of satisfaction in his tone. And with the sound of it\\n\\nI saw a ripple of something like uneasiness pass over all those faces\\n\\ngrouped at the other end of the room. There was a suggestion in all\\n\\nthis as of a trap—a trap that had closed.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot read from a list in an important manner.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mrs. Ackroyd, Miss Flora Ackroyd, Major Blunt, Mr. Geoffrey Raymond,\\n\\nMrs. Ralph Paton, John Parker, Elizabeth Russell.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe laid the paper down on the table.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What’s the meaning of all this?” began Raymond.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The list I have just read,” said Poirot, “is a list of suspected\\n\\npersons. Every one of you present had the opportunity to kill Mr.\\n\\nAckroyd——”\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a cry Mrs. Ackroyd sprang up, her throat working.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t like it,” she wailed. “I don’t like it. I would much prefer to\\n\\ngo home.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You cannot go home, madame,” said Poirot sternly, “until you have\\n\\nheard what I have to say.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe paused a moment, then cleared his throat.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will start at the beginning. When Miss Ackroyd asked me to\\n\\ninvestigate the case, I went up to Fernly Park with the good Dr.\\n\\nSheppard. I walked with him along the terrace, where I was shown the\\n\\nfootprints on the window-sill. From there Inspector Raglan took me\\n\\nalong the path which leads to the drive. My eye was caught by a little\\n\\nsummer-house, and I searched it thoroughly. I found two things—a scrap\\n\\nof starched cambric and an empty goose quill. The scrap of cambric\\n\\nimmediately suggested to me a maid’s apron. When Inspector Raglan\\n\\nshowed me his list of the people in the house, I noticed at once that\\n\\none of the maids—Ursula Bourne, the parlormaid—had no real alibi.\\n\\nAccording to her own story, she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty\\n\\nuntil ten. But supposing that instead she was in the summer-house?\\n\\nIf so, she must have gone there to meet some one. Now we know from\\n\\nDr. Sheppard that some one from outside _did_ come to the house that\\n\\nnight—the stranger whom he met just by the gate. At a first glance it\\n\\nwould seem that our problem was solved, and that the stranger went to\\n\\nthe summer-house to meet Ursula Bourne. It was fairly certain that he\\n\\n_did_ go to the summer-house because of the goose quill. That suggested\\n\\nat once to my mind a taker of drugs—and one who had acquired the habit\\n\\non the other side of the Atlantic where sniffing ‘snow’ is more common\\n\\nthan in this country. The man whom Dr. Sheppard met had an American\\n\\naccent, which fitted in with that supposition.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But I was held up by one point. _The times did not fit._ Ursula\\n\\nBourne could certainly not have gone to the summer-house before\\n\\nnine-thirty, whereas the man must have got there by a few minutes\\n\\npast nine. I could, of course, assume that he waited there for half\\n\\nan hour. The only alternative supposition was that there had been two\\n\\nseparate meetings in the summer-house that night. _Eh bien_, as soon\\n\\nas I went into that alternative I found several significant facts. I\\n\\ndiscovered that Miss Russell, the housekeeper, had visited Dr. Sheppard\\n\\nthat morning, and had displayed a good deal of interest in cures for\\n\\nvictims of the drug habit. Taking that in conjunction with the goose\\n\\nquill, I assumed that the man in question came to Fernly to meet the\\n\\nhousekeeper, and not Ursula Bourne. Who, then, did Ursula Bourne come\\n\\nto the rendezvous to meet? I was not long in doubt. First I found a\\n\\nring—a wedding ring—with ‘From R.’ and a date inside it. Then I learnt\\n\\nthat Ralph Paton had been seen coming up the path which led to the\\n\\nsummer-house at twenty-five minutes past nine, and I also heard of\\n\\na certain conversation which had taken place in the wood near the\\n\\nvillage that very afternoon—a conversation between Ralph Paton and\\n\\nsome unknown girl. So I had my facts succeeding each other in a neat\\n\\nand orderly manner. A secret marriage, an engagement announced on the\\n\\nday of the tragedy, the stormy interview in the wood, and the meeting\\n\\narranged for the summer-house that night.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Incidentally this proved to me one thing, that both Ralph Paton and\\n\\nUrsula Bourne (or Paton) had the strongest motives for wishing Mr.\\n\\nAckroyd out of the way. And it also made one other point unexpectedly\\n\\nclear. It could not have been Ralph Paton who was with Mr. Ackroyd in\\n\\nthe study at nine-thirty.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So we come to another and most interesting aspect of the crime. Who\\n\\nwas it in the room with Mr. Ackroyd at nine-thirty? Not Ralph Paton,\\n\\nwho was in the summer-house with his wife. Not Charles Kent, who\\n\\nhad already left. Who, then? I posed my cleverest—my most audacious\\n\\nquestion: _Was any one with him?_”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot leaned forward and shot the last words triumphantly at us,\\n\\ndrawing back afterwards with the air of one who has made a decided hit.\\n\\n\\n\\nRaymond, however, did not seem impressed, and lodged a mild protest.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know if you’re trying to make me out a liar, M. Poirot, but\\n\\nthe matter does not rest on my evidence alone—except perhaps as to the\\n\\nexact words used. Remember, Major Blunt also heard Mr. Ackroyd talking\\n\\nto some one. He was on the terrace outside, and couldn’t catch the\\n\\nwords clearly, but he distinctly heard the voices.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I have not forgotten,” he said quietly. “But Major Blunt was under the\\n\\nimpression that it was _you_ to whom Mr. Ackroyd was speaking.”\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment Raymond seemed taken aback. Then he recovered himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Blunt knows now that he was mistaken,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Exactly,” agreed the other man.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yet there must have been some reason for his thinking so,” mused\\n\\nPoirot. “Oh! no,” he held up his hand in protest, “I know the reason\\n\\nyou will give—but it is not enough. We must seek elsewhere. I will put\\n\\nit this way. From the beginning of the case I have been struck by one\\n\\nthing—the nature of those words which Mr. Raymond overheard. It has\\n\\nbeen amazing to me that no one has commented on them—has seen anything\\n\\nodd about them.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe paused a minute, and then quoted softly:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“... _The calls on my purse have been so frequent of late that I fear\\n\\nit is impossible for me to accede to your request._ Does nothing strike\\n\\nyou as odd about that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t think so,” said Raymond. “He has frequently dictated letters\\n\\nto me, using almost exactly those same words.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Exactly,” cried Poirot. “That is what I seek to arrive at. Would any\\n\\nman use such a phrase in _talking_ to another? Impossible that that\\n\\nshould be part of a real conversation. Now, if he had been dictating a\\n\\nletter——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You mean he was reading a letter aloud,” said Raymond slowly. “Even\\n\\nso, he must have been reading to some one.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“But why? We have no evidence that there was any one else in the room.\\n\\nNo other voice but Mr. Ackroyd’s was heard, remember.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Surely a man wouldn’t read letters of that type aloud to himself—not\\n\\nunless he was—well—going balmy.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You have all forgotten one thing,” said Poirot softly: “the stranger\\n\\nwho called at the house the preceding Wednesday.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThey all stared at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But yes,” said Poirot, nodding encouragingly, “on Wednesday. The\\n\\nyoung man was not of himself important. But the firm he represented\\n\\ninterested me very much.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The Dictaphone Company,” gasped Raymond. “I see it now. A dictaphone.\\n\\nThat’s what you think?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Mr. Ackroyd had promised to invest in a dictaphone, you remember.\\n\\nMe, I had the curiosity to inquire of the company in question. Their\\n\\nreply is that Mr. Ackroyd _did_ purchase a dictaphone from their\\n\\nrepresentative. Why he concealed the matter from you, I do not know.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“He must have meant to surprise me with it,” murmured Raymond. “He had\\n\\nquite a childish love of surprising people. Meant to keep it up his\\n\\nsleeve for a day or so. Probably was playing with it like a new toy.\\n\\nYes, it fits in. You’re quite right—no one would use quite those words\\n\\nin casual conversation.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It explains, too,” said Poirot, “why Major Blunt thought it was you\\n\\nwho were in the study. Such scraps as came to him were fragments of\\n\\ndictation, and so his subconscious mind deduced that you were with him.\\n\\nHis conscious mind was occupied with something quite different—the\\n\\nwhite figure he had caught a glimpse of. He fancied it was Miss\\n\\nAckroyd. Really, of course, it was Ursula Bourne’s white apron he saw\\n\\nas she was stealing down to the summer-house.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRaymond had recovered from his first surprise.\\n\\n\\n\\n“All the same,” he remarked, “this discovery of yours, brilliant though\\n\\nit is (I’m quite sure I should never have thought of it), leaves the\\n\\nessential position unchanged. Mr. Ackroyd was alive at nine-thirty,\\n\\nsince he was speaking into the dictaphone. It seems clear that the man\\n\\nCharles Kent was really off the premises by then. As to Ralph Paton——?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe hesitated, glancing at Ursula.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer color flared up, but she answered steadily enough.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ralph and I parted just before a quarter to ten. He never went near\\n\\nthe house, I am sure of that. He had no intention of doing so. The last\\n\\nthing on earth he wanted was to face his stepfather. He would have\\n\\nfunked it badly.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It isn’t that I doubt your story for a moment,” explained Raymond.\\n\\n“I’ve always been quite sure Captain Paton was innocent. But one has to\\n\\nthink of a court of law—and the questions that would be asked. He is in\\n\\na most unfortunate position, but if he were to come forward——”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot interrupted.\\n\\n\\n\\n“That is your advice, yes? That he should come forward?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Certainly. If you know where he is——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I perceive that you do not believe that I do know. And yet I have told\\n\\nyou just now that I know everything. The truth of the telephone call,\\n\\nof the footprints on the window-sill, of the hiding-place of Ralph\\n\\nPaton——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where is he?” said Blunt sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Not very far away,” said Poirot, smiling.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In Cranchester?” I asked.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot turned towards me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Always you ask me that. The idea of Cranchester it is with you an\\n\\n_idée fixe_. No, he is not in Cranchester. He is—_there_!”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe pointed a dramatic forefinger. Every one’s head turned.\\n\\n\\n\\nRalph Paton was standing in the doorway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXIV\\n\\n\\n\\n                          RALPH PATON’S STORY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a very uncomfortable minute for _me_. I hardly took in what\\n\\nhappened next, but there were exclamations and cries of surprise! When\\n\\nI was sufficiently master of myself to be able to realize what was\\n\\ngoing on, Ralph Paton was standing by his wife, her hand in his, and he\\n\\nwas smiling across the room at me.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot, too, was smiling, and at the same time shaking an eloquent\\n\\nfinger at me.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Have I not told you at least thirty-six times that it is useless to\\n\\nconceal things from Hercule Poirot?” he demanded. “That in such a case\\n\\nhe finds out?”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe turned to the others.\\n\\n\\n\\n“One day, you remember, we held a little séance about a table—just\\n\\nthe six of us. I accused the other five persons present of concealing\\n\\nsomething from me. Four of them gave up their secret. Dr. Sheppard did\\n\\nnot give up his. But all along I have had my suspicions. Dr. Sheppard\\n\\nwent to the Three Boars that night hoping to find Ralph. He did not\\n\\nfind him there; but supposing, I said to myself, that he met him in the\\n\\nstreet on his way home? Dr. Sheppard was a friend of Captain Paton’s,\\n\\nand he had come straight from the scene of the crime. He must know that\\n\\nthings looked very black against him. Perhaps he knew more than the\\n\\ngeneral public did——”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I did,” I said ruefully. “I suppose I might as well make a clean\\n\\nbreast of things now. I went to see Ralph that afternoon. At first he\\n\\nrefused to take me into his confidence, but later he told me about his\\n\\nmarriage, and the hole he was in. As soon as the murder was discovered,\\n\\nI realized that once the facts were known, suspicion could not fail to\\n\\nattach to Ralph—or, if not to him, to the girl he loved. That night I\\n\\nput the facts plainly before him. The thought of having possibly to\\n\\ngive evidence which might incriminate his wife made him resolve at all\\n\\ncosts to—to——”\\n\\n\\n\\nI hesitated, and Ralph filled up the gap.\\n\\n\\n\\n“To do a bunk,” he said graphically. “You see, Ursula left me to go\\n\\nback to the house. I thought it possible that she might have attempted\\n\\nto have another interview with my stepfather. He had already been very\\n\\nrude to her that afternoon. It occurred to me that he might have so\\n\\ninsulted her—in such an unforgivable manner—that without knowing what\\n\\nshe was doing——”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe stopped. Ursula released her hand from his, and stepped back.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You thought that, Ralph! You actually thought that I might have done\\n\\nit?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Let us get back to the culpable conduct of Dr. Sheppard,” said Poirot\\n\\ndryly. “Dr. Sheppard consented to do what he could to help him. He was\\n\\nsuccessful in hiding Captain Paton from the police.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Where?” asked Raymond. “In his own house?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ah, no, indeed,” said Poirot. “You should ask yourself the question\\n\\nthat I did. If the good doctor is concealing the young man, what place\\n\\nwould he choose? It must necessarily be somewhere near at hand. I think\\n\\nof Cranchester. A hotel? No. Lodgings? Even more emphatically, no.\\n\\nWhere, then? Ah! I have it. A nursing home. A home for the mentally\\n\\nunfit. I test my theory. I invent a nephew with mental trouble. I\\n\\nconsult Mademoiselle Sheppard as to suitable homes. She gives me the\\n\\nnames of two near Cranchester to which her brother has sent patients. I\\n\\nmake inquiries. Yes, at one of them a patient was brought there by the\\n\\ndoctor himself early on Saturday morning. That patient, though known\\n\\nby another name, I had no difficulty in identifying as Captain Paton.\\n\\nAfter certain necessary formalities, I was allowed to bring him away.\\n\\nHe arrived at my house in the early hours of yesterday morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI looked at him ruefully.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Caroline’s Home Office expert,” I murmured. “And to think I never\\n\\nguessed!”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You see now why I drew attention to the reticence of your manuscript,”\\n\\nmurmured Poirot. “It was strictly truthful as far as it went—but it did\\n\\nnot go very far, eh, my friend?”\\n\\n\\n\\nI was too abashed to argue.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dr. Sheppard has been very loyal,” said Ralph. “He has stood by me\\n\\nthrough thick and thin. He did what he thought was the best. I see now,\\n\\nfrom what M. Poirot has told me, that it was not really the best. I\\n\\nshould have come forward and faced the music. You see, in the home, we\\n\\nnever saw a newspaper. I knew nothing of what was going on.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Dr. Sheppard has been a model of discretion,” said Poirot dryly. “But\\n\\nme, I discover all the little secrets. It is my business.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now we can have your story of what happened that night,” said Raymond\\n\\nimpatiently.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You know it already,” said Ralph. “There’s very little for me to add.\\n\\nI left the summer-house about nine-forty-five, and tramped about the\\n\\nlanes, trying to make up my mind as to what to do next—what line to\\n\\ntake. I’m bound to admit that I’ve not the shadow of an alibi, but I\\n\\ngive you my solemn word that I never went to the study, that I never\\n\\nsaw my stepfather alive—or dead. Whatever the world thinks, I’d like\\n\\nall of you to believe me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“No alibi,” murmured Raymond. “That’s bad. I believe you, of course,\\n\\nbut—it’s a bad business.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“It makes things very simple, though,” said Poirot, in a cheerful\\n\\nvoice. “Very simple indeed.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWe all stared at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You see what I mean? No? Just this—to save Captain Paton the real\\n\\ncriminal must confess.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe beamed round at us all.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But yes—I mean what I say. See now, I did not invite Inspector Raglan\\n\\nto be present. That was for a reason. I did not want to tell him all\\n\\nthat I knew—at least I did not want to tell him to-night.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe leaned forward, and suddenly his voice and his whole personality\\n\\nchanged. He suddenly became dangerous.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I who speak to you—I know the murderer of Mr. Ackroyd is in this\\n\\nroom now. It is to the murderer I speak. _To-morrow the truth goes to\\n\\nInspector Raglan._ You understand?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a tense silence. Into the midst of it came the old Breton\\n\\nwoman with a telegram on a salver. Poirot tore it open.\\n\\n\\n\\nBlunt’s voice rose abrupt and resonant.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The murderer is amongst us, you say? You know—which?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot had read the message. He crumpled it up in his hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I know—now.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe tapped the crumpled ball of paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n“What is that?” said Raymond sharply.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A wireless message—from a steamer now on her way to the United States.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a dead silence. Poirot rose to his feet bowing.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Messieurs et Mesdames, this reunion of mine is at an end.\\n\\nRemember—_the truth goes to Inspector Raglan in the morning_.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XXV\\n\\n\\n\\n                            THE WHOLE TRUTH\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA slight gesture from Poirot enjoined me to stay behind the rest. I\\n\\nobeyed, going over to the fire and thoughtfully stirring the big logs\\n\\non it with the toe of my boot.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was puzzled. For the first time I was absolutely at sea as to\\n\\nPoirot’s meaning. For a moment I was inclined to think that the scene\\n\\nI had just witnessed was a gigantic piece of bombast—that he had been\\n\\nwhat he called “playing the comedy” with a view to making himself\\n\\ninteresting and important. But, in spite of myself, I was forced to\\n\\nbelieve in an underlying reality. There had been real menace in his\\n\\nwords—a certain indisputable sincerity. But I still believed him to be\\n\\non entirely the wrong tack.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the door shut behind the last of the party he came over to the\\n\\nfire.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, my friend,” he said quietly, “and what do you think of it all?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know what to think,” I said frankly. “What was the point? Why\\n\\nnot go straight to Inspector Raglan with the truth instead of giving\\n\\nthe guilty person this elaborate warning?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot sat down and drew out his case of tiny Russian cigarettes. He\\n\\nsmoked for a minute or two in silence. Then:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Use your little gray cells,” he said. “There is always a reason behind\\n\\nmy actions.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI hesitated for a moment, and then I said slowly:\\n\\n\\n\\n“The first one that occurs to me is that you yourself do not know who\\n\\nthe guilty person is, but that you are sure that he is to be found\\n\\namongst the people here to-night. Therefore your words were intended to\\n\\nforce a confession from the unknown murderer?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded approvingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“A clever idea, but not the truth.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I thought, perhaps, that by making him believe you knew, you might\\n\\nforce him out into the open—not necessarily by confession. He might try\\n\\nto silence you as he formerly silenced Mr. Ackroyd—before you could act\\n\\nto-morrow morning.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“A trap with myself as the bait! _Merci, mon ami_, but I am not\\n\\nsufficiently heroic for that.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Then I fail to understand you. Surely you are running the risk of\\n\\nletting the murderer escape by thus putting him on his guard?”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n“He cannot escape,” he said gravely. “There is only one way out—and\\n\\nthat way does not lead to freedom.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You really believe that one of those people here to-night committed\\n\\nthe murder?” I asked incredulously.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, my friend.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Which one?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a silence for some minutes. Then Poirot tossed the stump of\\n\\nhis cigarette into the grate and began to speak in a quiet, reflective\\n\\ntone.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will take you the way that I have traveled myself. Step by step\\n\\nyou shall accompany me, and see for yourself that all the facts point\\n\\nindisputably to one person. Now, to begin with, there were two facts\\n\\nand one little discrepancy in time which especially attracted my\\n\\nattention. The first fact was the telephone call. If Ralph Paton were\\n\\nindeed the murderer, the telephone call became meaningless and absurd.\\n\\nTherefore, I said to myself, Ralph Paton is not the murderer.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I satisfied myself that the call could not have been sent by any one\\n\\nin the house, yet I was convinced that it was amongst those present\\n\\non the fatal evening that I had to look for my criminal. Therefore I\\n\\nconcluded that the telephone call must have been sent by an accomplice.\\n\\nI was not quite pleased with that deduction, but I let it stand for the\\n\\nminute.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I next examined the _motive_ for the call. That was difficult. I could\\n\\nonly get at it by judging its _result_. Which was—that the murder was\\n\\ndiscovered that night instead of—in all probability—the following\\n\\nmorning. You agree with that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ye-es,” I admitted. “Yes. As you say, Mr. Ackroyd, having given orders\\n\\nthat he was not to be disturbed, nobody would have been likely to go to\\n\\nthe study that night.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“_Très bien._ The affair marches, does it not? But matters were\\n\\nstill obscure. What was the advantage of having the crime discovered\\n\\nthat night in preference to the following morning? The only idea I\\n\\ncould get hold of was that the murderer, knowing the crime was to be\\n\\ndiscovered at a certain time, could make sure of being present when the\\n\\ndoor was broken in—or at any rate immediately afterwards. And now we\\n\\ncome to the second fact—the chair pulled out from the wall. Inspector\\n\\nRaglan dismissed that as of no importance. I, on the contrary, have\\n\\nalways regarded it as of supreme importance.\\n\\n\\n\\n“In your manuscript you have drawn a neat little plan of the study.\\n\\nIf you had it with you this minute you would see that—the chair being\\n\\ndrawn out in the position indicated by Parker—it would stand in a\\n\\ndirect line between the door and the window.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The window!” I said quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You, too, have my first idea. I imagined that the chair was drawn out\\n\\nso that something connected with the window should not be seen by any\\n\\none entering through the door. But I soon abandoned that supposition,\\n\\nfor though the chair was a grandfather with a high back, it obscured\\n\\nvery little of the window—only the part between the sash and the\\n\\nground. No, _mon ami_—but remember that just in front of the window\\n\\nthere stood a table with books and magazines upon it. Now that table\\n\\n_was_ completely hidden by the drawn-out chair—and immediately I had my\\n\\nfirst shadowy suspicion of the truth.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Supposing that there had been something on that table not intended\\n\\nto be seen? Something placed there by the murderer? As yet I had no\\n\\ninkling of what that something might be. But I knew certain very\\n\\ninteresting facts about it. For instance, it was something that the\\n\\nmurderer had not been able to take away with him at the time that he\\n\\ncommitted the crime. At the same time it was vital that it should be\\n\\nremoved as soon as possible after the crime had been discovered. And\\n\\nso—the telephone message, and the opportunity for the murderer to be on\\n\\nthe spot when the body was discovered.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now four people were on the scene before the police arrived. Yourself,\\n\\nParker, Major Blunt, and Mr. Raymond. Parker I eliminated at once,\\n\\nsince at whatever time the crime was discovered, he was the one\\n\\nperson certain to be on the spot. Also it was he who told me of the\\n\\npulled-out chair. Parker, then, was cleared (of the murder, that is. I\\n\\nstill thought it possible that he had been blackmailing Mrs. Ferrars).\\n\\nRaymond and Blunt, however, remained under suspicion since, if the\\n\\ncrime had been discovered in the early hours of the morning, it was\\n\\nquite possible that they might have arrived on the scene too late to\\n\\nprevent the object on the round table being discovered.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now what was that object? You heard my arguments to-night in reference\\n\\nto the scrap of conversation overheard? As soon as I learned that\\n\\na representative of a dictaphone company had called, the idea of a\\n\\ndictaphone took root in my mind. You heard what I said in this room not\\n\\nhalf an hour ago? They all agreed with my theory—but one vital fact\\n\\nseems to have escaped them. Granted that a dictaphone was being used by\\n\\nMr. Ackroyd that night—why was no dictaphone found?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I never thought of that,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We know that a dictaphone was supplied to Mr. Ackroyd. But no\\n\\ndictaphone has been found amongst his effects. So, if something was\\n\\ntaken from that table—why should not that something be the dictaphone?\\n\\nBut there were certain difficulties in the way. The attention of every\\n\\none was, of course, focused on the murdered man. I think any one could\\n\\nhave gone to the table unnoticed by the other people in the room. But\\n\\na dictaphone has a certain bulk—it cannot be slipped casually into\\n\\na pocket. There must have been a receptacle of some kind capable of\\n\\nholding it.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You see where I am arriving? The figure of the murderer is taking\\n\\nshape. A person who was on the scene straightway, but who might not\\n\\nhave been if the crime had been discovered the following morning.\\n\\nA person carrying a receptacle into which the dictaphone might be\\n\\nfitted——”\\n\\n\\n\\nI interrupted.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But why remove the dictaphone? What was the point?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You are like Mr. Raymond. You take it for granted that what was heard\\n\\nat nine-thirty was Mr. Ackroyd’s voice speaking into a dictaphone. But\\n\\nconsider this useful invention for a little minute. You dictate into\\n\\nit, do you not? And at some later time a secretary or a typist turns it\\n\\non, and the voice speaks again.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You mean——” I gasped.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I mean that. _At nine-thirty Mr. Ackroyd was already dead._ It\\n\\nwas the dictaphone speaking—not the man.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And the murderer switched it on. Then he must have been in the room at\\n\\nthat minute?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Possibly. But we must not exclude the likelihood of some mechanical\\n\\ndevice having been applied—something after the nature of a time lock,\\n\\nor even of a simple alarm clock. But in that case we must add two\\n\\nqualifications to our imaginary portrait of the murderer. It must be\\n\\nsome one who knew of Mr. Ackroyd’s purchase of the dictaphone and also\\n\\nsome one with the necessary mechanical knowledge.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I had got thus far in my own mind when we came to the footprints on\\n\\nthe window ledge. Here there were three conclusions open to me. (1)\\n\\nThey might really have been made by Ralph Paton. He had been at Fernly\\n\\nthat night, and might have climbed into the study and found his uncle\\n\\ndead there. That was one hypothesis. (2) There was the possibility that\\n\\nthe footmarks might have been made by somebody else who happened to\\n\\nhave the same kind of studs in his shoes. But the inmates of the house\\n\\nhad shoes soled with crepe rubber, and I declined to believe in the\\n\\ncoincidence of some one from outside having the same kind of shoes as\\n\\nRalph Paton wore. Charles Kent, as we know from the barmaid of the Dog\\n\\nand Whistle, had on a pair of boots ‘clean dropping off him.’ (3) Those\\n\\nprints were made by some one deliberately trying to throw suspicion\\n\\non Ralph Paton. To test this last conclusion, it was necessary to\\n\\nascertain certain facts. One pair of Ralph’s shoes had been obtained\\n\\nfrom the Three Boars by the police. Neither Ralph nor any one else\\n\\ncould have worn them that evening, since they were downstairs being\\n\\ncleaned. According to the police theory, Ralph was wearing another pair\\n\\nof the same kind, and I found out that it was true that he had two\\n\\npairs. Now for my theory to be proved correct it was necessary for the\\n\\nmurderer to have worn Ralph’s shoes that evening—in which case Ralph\\n\\nmust have been wearing yet a _third_ pair of footwear of some kind.\\n\\nI could hardly suppose that he would bring three pairs of shoes all\\n\\nalike—the third pair of footwear were more likely to be boots. I got\\n\\nyour sister to make inquiries on this point—laying some stress on the\\n\\ncolor, in order—I admit it frankly—to obscure the real reason for my\\n\\nasking.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You know the result of her investigations. Ralph Paton _had_ had a\\n\\npair of boots with him. The first question I asked him when he came to\\n\\nmy house yesterday morning was what he was wearing on his feet on the\\n\\nfatal night. He replied at once that he had worn _boots_—he was still\\n\\nwearing them, in fact—having nothing else to put on.\\n\\n\\n\\n“So we get a step further in our description of the murderer—a person\\n\\nwho had the opportunity to take these shoes of Ralph Paton’s from the\\n\\nThree Boars that day.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe paused, and then said, with a slightly raised voice:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“There is one further point. The murderer must have been a person who\\n\\nhad the opportunity to purloin that dagger from the silver table. You\\n\\nmight argue that any one in the house might have done so, but I will\\n\\nrecall to you that Miss Ackroyd was very positive that the dagger was\\n\\nnot there when she examined the silver table.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe paused again.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Let us recapitulate—now that all is clear. A person who was at the\\n\\nThree Boars earlier that day, a person who knew Ackroyd well enough\\n\\nto know that he had purchased a dictaphone, a person who was of a\\n\\nmechanical turn of mind, who had the opportunity to take the dagger\\n\\nfrom the silver table before Miss Flora arrived, who had with him a\\n\\nreceptacle suitable for hiding the dictaphone—such as a black bag, and\\n\\nwho had the study to himself for a few minutes after the crime was\\n\\ndiscovered while Parker was telephoning for the police. In fact—_Dr.\\n\\nSheppard!_”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXVI\\n\\n\\n\\n                       AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a dead silence for a minute and a half.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen I laughed.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re mad,” I said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“No,” said Poirot placidly. “I am not mad. It was the little\\n\\ndiscrepancy in time that first drew my attention to you—right at the\\n\\nbeginning.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Discrepancy in time?” I queried, puzzled.\\n\\n\\n\\n“But yes. You will remember that every one agreed—you yourself\\n\\nincluded—that it took five minutes to walk from the lodge to the\\n\\nhouse—less if you took the short cut to the terrace. But you left the\\n\\nhouse at ten minutes to nine—both by your own statement and that of\\n\\nParker, and yet it was nine o’clock as you passed through the lodge\\n\\ngates. It was a chilly night—not an evening a man would be inclined to\\n\\ndawdle; why had you taken ten minutes to do a five-minutes’ walk? All\\n\\nalong I realized that we had only your statement for it that the study\\n\\nwindow was ever fastened. Ackroyd asked you if you had done so—he never\\n\\nlooked to see. Supposing, then, that the study window was unfastened?\\n\\nWould there be time in that ten minutes for you to run round the\\n\\noutside of the house, change your shoes, climb in through the window,\\n\\nkill Ackroyd, and get to the gate by nine o’clock? I decided against\\n\\nthat theory since in all probability a man as nervous as Ackroyd was\\n\\nthat night would hear you climbing in, and then there would have been\\n\\na struggle. But supposing that you killed Ackroyd _before_ you left—as\\n\\nyou were standing beside his chair? Then you go out of the front door,\\n\\nrun round to the summer-house, take Ralph Paton’s shoes out of the bag\\n\\nyou brought up with you that night, slip them on, walk through the\\n\\nmud in them, and leave prints on the window ledge, you climb in, lock\\n\\nthe study door on the inside, run back to the summer-house, change\\n\\nback into your own shoes, and race down to the gate. (I went through\\n\\nsimilar actions the other day, when you were with Mrs. Ackroyd—it took\\n\\nten minutes exactly.) Then home—and an alibi—since you had timed the\\n\\ndictaphone for half-past nine.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear Poirot,” I said in a voice that sounded strange and forced to\\n\\nmy own ears, “you’ve been brooding over this case too long. What on\\n\\nearth had I to gain by murdering Ackroyd?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Safety. It was you who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars. Who could have had\\n\\na better knowledge of what killed Mr. Ferrars than the doctor who was\\n\\nattending him? When you spoke to me that first day in the garden,\\n\\nyou mentioned a legacy received about a year ago. I have been unable\\n\\nto discover any trace of a legacy. You had to invent some way of\\n\\naccounting for Mrs. Ferrars’s twenty thousand pounds. It has not done\\n\\nyou much good. You lost most of it in speculation—then you put the\\n\\nscrew on too hard, and Mrs. Ferrars took a way out that you had not\\n\\nexpected. If Ackroyd had learnt the truth he would have had no mercy on\\n\\nyou—you were ruined for ever.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“And the telephone call?” I asked, trying to rally. “You have a\\n\\nplausible explanation of that also, I suppose?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will confess to you that it was my greatest stumbling block when\\n\\nI found that a call had actually been put through to you from King’s\\n\\nAbbot station. I at first believed that you had simply invented the\\n\\nstory. It was a very clever touch, that. You must have some excuse for\\n\\narriving at Fernly, finding the body, and so getting the chance to\\n\\nremove the dictaphone on which your alibi depended. I had a very vague\\n\\nnotion of how it was worked when I came to see your sister that first\\n\\nday and inquired as to what patients you had seen on Friday morning. I\\n\\nhad no thought of Miss Russell in my mind at that time. Her visit was a\\n\\nlucky coincidence, since it distracted your mind from the real object\\n\\nof my questions. I found what I was looking for. Among your patients\\n\\nthat morning was the steward of an American liner. Who more suitable\\n\\nthan he to be leaving for Liverpool by the train that evening? And\\n\\nafterwards he would be on the high seas, well out of the way. I noted\\n\\nthat the _Orion_ sailed on Saturday, and having obtained the name of\\n\\nthe steward I sent him a wireless message asking a certain question.\\n\\nThis is his reply you saw me receive just now.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHe held out the message to me. It ran as follows—\\n\\n\\n\\n“Quite correct. Dr. Sheppard asked me to leave a note at a patient’s\\n\\nhouse. I was to ring him up from the station with the reply. Reply was\\n\\n‘No answer.’”\\n\\n\\n\\n                   *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n\\n“It was a clever idea,” said Poirot. “The call was genuine. Your sister\\n\\nsaw you take it. But there was only one man’s word as to what was\\n\\nactually said—your own!”\\n\\n\\n\\nI yawned.\\n\\n\\n\\n“All this,” I said, “is very interesting—but hardly in the sphere of\\n\\npractical politics.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You think not? Remember what I said—the truth goes to Inspector Raglan\\n\\nin the morning. But, for the sake of your good sister, I am willing to\\n\\ngive you the chance of another way out. There might be, for instance,\\n\\nan overdose of a sleeping draught. You comprehend me? But Captain Ralph\\n\\nPaton must be cleared—_ça va sans dire_. I should suggest that you\\n\\nfinish that very interesting manuscript of yours—but abandoning your\\n\\nformer reticence.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You seem to be very prolific of suggestions,” I remarked. “Are you\\n\\nsure you’ve quite finished.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Now that you remind me of the fact, it is true that there is one thing\\n\\nmore. It would be most unwise on your part to attempt to silence me as\\n\\nyou silenced M. Ackroyd. That kind of business does not succeed against\\n\\nHercule Poirot, you understand.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“My dear Poirot,” I said, smiling a little, “whatever else I may be, I\\n\\nam not a fool.”\\n\\n\\n\\nI rose to my feet.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Well, well,” I said, with a slight yawn, “I must be off home. Thank\\n\\nyou for a most interesting and instructive evening.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot also rose and bowed with his accustomed politeness as I passed\\n\\nout of the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\\n\\n\\n\\n                               APOLOGIA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFive a.m. I am very tired—but I have finished my task. My arm aches\\n\\nfrom writing.\\n\\n\\n\\nA strange end to my manuscript. I meant it to be published some day as\\n\\nthe history of one of Poirot’s failures! Odd, how things pan out.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll along I’ve had a premonition of disaster, from the moment I saw\\n\\nRalph Paton and Mrs. Ferrars with their heads together. I thought then\\n\\nthat she was confiding in him; as it happened I was quite wrong there,\\n\\nbut the idea persisted even after I went into the study with Ackroyd\\n\\nthat night, until he told me the truth.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoor old Ackroyd. I’m always glad that I gave him a chance. I urged him\\n\\nto read that letter before it was too late. Or let me be honest—didn’t\\n\\nI subconsciously realize that with a pig-headed chap like him, it was\\n\\nmy best chance of getting him _not_ to read it? His nervousness that\\n\\nnight was interesting psychologically. He knew danger was close at\\n\\nhand. And yet he never suspected _me_.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe dagger was an afterthought. I’d brought up a very handy little\\n\\nweapon of my own, but when I saw the dagger lying in the silver table,\\n\\nit occurred to me at once how much better it would be to use a weapon\\n\\nthat couldn’t be traced to me.\\n\\n\\n\\nI suppose I must have meant to murder him all along. As soon as I heard\\n\\nof Mrs. Ferrars’s death, I felt convinced that she would have told him\\n\\neverything before she died. When I met him and he seemed so agitated,\\n\\nI thought that perhaps he knew the truth, but that he couldn’t bring\\n\\nhimself to believe it, and was going to give me the chance of refuting\\n\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I went home and took my precautions. If the trouble were after all\\n\\nonly something to do with Ralph—well, no harm would have been done. The\\n\\ndictaphone he had given me two days before to adjust. Something had\\n\\ngone a little wrong with it, and I persuaded him to let me have a go at\\n\\nit, instead of sending it back. I did what I wanted to it, and took it\\n\\nup with me in my bag that evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am rather pleased with myself as a writer. What could be neater, for\\n\\ninstance, than the following:—\\n\\n\\n\\n“_The letters were brought in at twenty minutes to nine. It was just\\n\\non ten minutes to nine when I left him, the letter still unread. I\\n\\nhesitated with my hand on the door handle, looking back and wondering\\n\\nif there was anything I had left undone._”\\n\\n\\n\\nAll true, you see. But suppose I had put a row of stars after the first\\n\\nsentence! Would somebody then have wondered what exactly happened in\\n\\nthat blank ten minutes?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I looked round the room from the door, I was quite satisfied.\\n\\nNothing had been left undone. The dictaphone was on the table by the\\n\\nwindow, timed to go off at nine-thirty (the mechanism of that little\\n\\ndevice was rather clever—based on the principle of an alarm clock), and\\n\\nthe arm-chair was pulled out so as to hide it from the door.\\n\\n\\n\\nI must admit that it gave me rather a shock to run into Parker just\\n\\noutside the door. I have faithfully recorded that fact.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen later, when the body was discovered, and I had sent Parker to\\n\\ntelephone for the police, what a judicious use of words: “_I did\\n\\nwhat little had to be done!_” It was quite little—just to shove the\\n\\ndictaphone into my bag and push back the chair against the wall in\\n\\nits proper place. I never dreamed that Parker would have noticed\\n\\nthat chair. Logically, he ought to have been so agog over the body\\n\\nas to be blind to everything else. But I hadn’t reckoned with the\\n\\ntrained-servant complex.\\n\\n\\n\\nI wish I could have known beforehand that Flora was going to say she’d\\n\\nseen her uncle alive at a quarter to ten. That puzzled me more than\\n\\nI can say. In fact, all through the case there have been things that\\n\\npuzzled me hopelessly. Every one seems to have taken a hand.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy greatest fear all through has been Caroline. I have fancied she\\n\\nmight guess. Curious the way she spoke that day of my “strain of\\n\\nweakness.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, she will never know the truth. There is, as Poirot said, one way\\n\\nout....\\n\\n\\n\\nI can trust him. He and Inspector Raglan will manage it between them. I\\n\\nshould not like Caroline to know. She is fond of me, and then, too, she\\n\\nis proud....

In 2001, the Project\\n\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\n\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\n\\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\n\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\n\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\n\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\n\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\n\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\n\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\n\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\n\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\n\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\n\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\n\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\n\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\n\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\n\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\n\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\n\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\n\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\n\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\n\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\n\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\n\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\n\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\n\\n\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessor Michael S.

      "\n",

      "along the path which leads to the drive. My eye was caught by a little\n",

      "of starched cambric and an empty goose quill. The scrap of cambric\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "According to her own story, she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty\n",
      "\n",
      "until ten. But supposing that instead she was in the summer-house?\n",
      "\n",
      "If so, she must have gone there to meet some one. Now we know from\n",

      "Dr. Sheppard that some one from outside _did_ come to the house that\n",

      "night—the stranger whom he met just by the gate. At a first glance it\n",
      "\n",
      "would seem that our problem was solved, and that the stranger went to\n",
      "\n",
      "the summer-house to meet Ursula Bourne. It was fairly certain that he\n",
      "\n",
      "_did_ go to the summer-house because of the goose quill. That suggested\n",
      "\n",
      "at once to my mind a taker of drugs—and one who had acquired the habit\n",
      "\n",
      "on the other side of the Atlantic where sniffing ‘snow’ is more common\n",
      "\n",
      "than in this country. The man whom Dr. Sheppard met had an American\n",

      "\n",
      "nine-thirty, whereas the man must have got there by a few minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "past nine. I could, of course, assume that he waited there for half\n",
      "\n",
      "an hour. The only alternative supposition was that there had been two\n",
      "\n",
      "separate meetings in the summer-house that night. _Eh bien_, as soon\n",
      "\n",
      "as I went into that alternative I found several significant facts. I\n",

      "that morning, and had displayed a good deal of interest in cures for\n",

      "victims of the drug habit. Taking that in conjunction with the goose\n",
      "\n",
      "quill, I assumed that the man in question came to Fernly to meet the\n",

      "housekeeper, and not Ursula Bourne. Who, then, did Ursula Bourne come\n",
      "\n",
      "to the rendezvous to meet? I was not long in doubt. First I found a\n",
      "\n",
      "ring—a wedding ring—with ‘From R.’ and a date inside it. Then I learnt\n",
      "\n",
      "that Ralph Paton had been seen coming up the path which led to the\n",
      "\n",
      "summer-house at twenty-five minutes past nine, and I also heard of\n",
      "\n",
      "a certain conversation which had taken place in the wood near the\n",
      "\n",
      "village that very afternoon—a conversation between Ralph Paton and\n",
      "\n",
      "some unknown girl. So I had my facts succeeding each other in a neat\n",
      "\n",
      "and orderly manner. A secret marriage, an engagement announced on the\n",

      "arranged for the summer-house that night.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ursula Bourne (or Paton) had the strongest motives for wishing Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ackroyd out of the way. And it also made one other point unexpectedly\n",
      "\n",
      "clear. It could not have been Ralph Paton who was with Mr. Ackroyd in\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "who was in the summer-house with his wife. Not Charles Kent, who\n",

      "the matter does not rest on my evidence alone—except perhaps as to the\n",
      "\n",
      "exact words used. Remember, Major Blunt also heard Mr. Ackroyd talking\n",

      "to some one. He was on the terrace outside, and couldn’t catch the\n",

      "you will give—but it is not enough. We must seek elsewhere. I will put\n",
      "\n",
      "it this way. From the beginning of the case I have been struck by one\n",

      "\n",
      "“Exactly,” cried Poirot. “That is what I seek to arrive at. Would any\n",

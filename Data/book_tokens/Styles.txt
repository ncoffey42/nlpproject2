medical evidence taken
breathless hush eye fixed famous london specialist known greatest authorities day subject toxicology
brief words specialist summed result post mortem
shorn result medical phraseology technicalities result amounted fact emilyInglethorp met emilyInglethorp death result strychnine poisoning
judging quantity recovered emilyInglethorp taken quarters grain strychnine probably grain slightly
possible emilyInglethorp swallowed poison accident
asked coroner
consider poison unlikely
strychnine domestic purposes poisons restrictions placed strychnine sale
examination lead determine poison administered

relate exactly happened
entered emilyInglethorp room
emilyInglethorp moment typical tetanic convulsion
emilyInglethorp turned gasped alfred alfred strychnine administered emilyInglethorp dinner coffee taken emilyInglethorp emilyInglethorp husband
possibly strychnine fairly rapid drug strychnine action
symptoms appear hours strychnine swallowed
strychnine retarded certain conditions appear present case
presume emilyInglethorp took coffee dinner symptoms manifest symptoms early hours morning face coffee points drug having taken later evening
emilyInglethorp habit drinking cup cocoa middle night
strychnine administered
took sample cocoa remaining saucepan strychnine analysed
strychnine present
heard poirot chuckle softly

whispered
listen
doctor considerably surprised result
simply strychnine unusually bitter taste
strychnine detected solution seventy thousand disguised strongly flavoured substance

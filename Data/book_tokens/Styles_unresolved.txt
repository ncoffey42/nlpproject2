liberal gentleman
oh thank sir sure
walked sharply
evelynhoward evelynHoward right experienced sharp twinge disgust thought alfred alfredinglethorp liberality woman money
piquant gipsy face crime baser mainspring money
probably judicious mixture
point poirot curious obsession
twice observed thought dorcas error fixing time quarrel
suggested repeatedly thirty heard voices
dorcas unshaken
hour elapsed time heard voices taken tea mistress
inquest held friday stylites arms village
poirot sat required evidence
preliminaries gone
jury viewed body johncavendish cavendish gave evidence identification
questioned described awakening early hours morning circumstances mother death
medical evidence taken
breathless hush eye fixed famous london specialist known greatest authorities day subject toxicology
brief words summed result post mortem
shorn medical phraseology technicalities amounted fact emilyinglethorp met death result strychnine poisoning
judging quantity recovered taken quarters grain strychnine probably grain slightly
possible swallowed poison accident asked coroner
consider unlikely
strychnine domestic purposes poisons restrictions placed sale
examination lead determine poison administered
arrived styles dr wilkins believe
motor met outside lodge gates hurried fast relate exactly happened
entered emilyinglethorp room
moment typical tetanic convulsion
turned gasped alfred alfred strychnine administered emilyinglethorp dinner coffee taken husband possibly strychnine fairly rapid drug action
symptoms appear hours swallowed
retarded certain conditions appear present case
presume emilyinglethorp took coffee dinner symptoms manifest early hours morning face points drug having taken later evening
emilyinglethorp habit drinking cup cocoa middle night
strychnine administered took sample cocoa remaining saucepan analysed
strychnine present
heard poirot chuckle softly
know
whispered
listen
doctor considerably surprised result
simply strychnine unusually bitter taste
detected solution seventy thousand disguised strongly flavoured substance
cocoa powerless mask
jury wanted know objection applied coffee
coffee bitter taste probably cover taste strychnine
consider likely drug administered coffee unknown reason action delayed
yes cup completely smashed possibility analyzing contents
concluded bauerstein evidence
dr wilkins corroborated points
sounded possibility suicide repudiated utterly
deceased said suffered weak heart enjoyed perfect health cheerful balanced disposition
people life
lawrencecavendish called
evidence unimportant mere repetition brother
step paused said hesitatingly like suggestion glanced deprecatingly coroner replied briskly certainly johncavendish arrive truth matter welcome lead elucidation
idea explained lawrencecavendish
course wrong mother death accounted natural means
johncavendish
mother time death time taking tonic containing strychnine
ah said coroner
jury looked interested
believe continued lawrencecavendish cases cumulative effect drug administered time ended causing death
possible taken overdose medicine accident
heard deceased taking strychnine time death
obliged johncavendish
dr wilkins recalled ridiculed idea
johncavendish suggests impossible
doctor tell
strychnine certain sense cumulative poison impossible result sudden death way
long period chronic symptoms attracted attention
thing absurd
second suggestion
emilyinglethorp inadvertently taken overdose doses resulted death
mrs alfredinglethorp extra large medicine time dealt coot cash chemists tadminster
nearly bottle account strychnine found post mortem
consider dismiss tonic way instrumental causing death certainly
supposition ridiculous
juryman interrupted suggested chemist medicine committed error
course possible replied doctor
dorcas witness called dispelled possibility
medicine newly
contrary emilyinglethorp taken dose day death
question tonic finally abandoned coroner proceeded task
